    "# Part 1: Launch a Grid Node Locally\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you'll learn how to deploy a grid node into a local machine and then interact with it using PySyft.\n",
    "\n",
    "_WARNING: Grid nodes publish datasets online and are for EXPERIMENTAL use only. Deploy nodes at your own risk. Do not use OpenGrid with any data/models you wish to keep private._\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to run a node locally all you need to do is run an application and then start communicating with it through a Grid Worker. In this tutorial we'll use the websocket app available [here](https://github.com/OpenMined/PyGrid/tree/dev/app/websocket).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Download the repository\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git clone https://github.com/OpenMined/PyGrid/\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Download dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll need to have the app dependencies installed. We recommend setting up an independent [conda environment](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/concepts/environments.html) to avoid problems with library versions.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can install the dependencies by running:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "cd PyGrid/app/websocket/\n",
    "pip install -r requirements.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Make grid importable\n",
    "\n",
    "Install grid as a python package\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "cd PyGrid\n",
    "python setup.py install (or python setup.py develop)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Start App\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, to start the app, just run the `websocket_app` script.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "cd PyGrid/app/websocket\n",
    "python websocket_app.py --db_url=<redis_url, None> --id=<worker_id> --port=<port number>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will start the app with id equals to `<worker_id>` on address: `http://0.0.0.0/<port_number>`. The `--db_url` starts a REDIS database. You can also use websocket with no db.\n",
    "\n",
    "To check what other arguments you can use when running this app, run:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python websocket_app.py --help\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start a worker with id equals to `bob` on port `3000`\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python websocket_app.py --db_url=redis:///redis:6379 --id=bob --port=3000\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Great. The script should continue running, if the app started successfully.\n"
