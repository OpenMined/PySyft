    "_To start, from a client perspective, we want to maximize for convenience and minimize the number of dependencies one needs to install to work with PyGrid. Thus, in an ideal world, users only have to install one python package in order to work with all of pygrid. I like the current design in syft 0.2.x where we have grid clients in a grid package inside of Syft. The thing we definitely want to avoid here is the need for users of PyGrid to have to install all of the dependencies needed to run grid nodes (flask, databases, etc.) just to be able to interact with the grid. Putting grid inside of syft solves this as well._ -->"

    "The various members of the network are called \"domains\". The difference between \"network\" and \"domain\" is that a \"domain\" represents someone who actually *owns* a dataset whereas a \"network\" exists to help you *find* a dataset. So, for example, even though the \"FitByte\" network might help you *find* data relating to people's fitness, each individual person running their own *domain* (on their phone) is considered the owner. Importantly, the domain owner is the one which accepts/denies your request to perform data science (not the network owner).\n",

    "### Understanding the Results\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we go and look into more relevant (sleep related) data, let's take a moment to consider what this table is all about. The far left \"name\" column is the name of the dataset. This name isn't designed to be a unique name, it's just whatever the Domain owner chose to call their dataset. The network and domain are what you'd expect, domain is the owner of the data and the network is the network the domain is hosted in (note a domain can connect to multiple networks).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pricing\n",
    "\n",
    "The next two columns are perhaps a bit perplexing. The goal here is to get a general sense for how expensive the dataset is as well as how expensive the co-located compute is. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Compute Prices\n",
    "\n",
    "\"USD/gpu_flop_hour\" is perhaps the most intuitive. It's the average price (over the GPUs available) of an hour of GPU time normalized by flop (since some GPUs are more powerful than others). This is not the metric you would actually pay for (you'd pick your GPU and rent by the hour like most providers). However, this is to give a sense for how expensive compute is on each domain provider. (Maybe someday we'll \"pay per flop\" but not yet.)\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Epsilon Prices\n",
    "\n",
    "USD/eps is perhaps a bit less intuitive. Epsilon is referring to the notion of epsilon from Differential Privacy literature.  Is is a measure of \"statistical uniqueness\" of results and it's the most important pricing metric for a variety of reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If epsilon is sufficiently high, the buyer could reverse engineer the dataset and then (in theory) sell it (or derivatives) as a competitor to you. Economically, this is the \"hard limit\" creating resource scarcity for how much a dataset can be used. While a dataset can always be worked with (in theory), giving too much epsilon to one player (or to players who will collude) can accidentally create a competitor.\n",
    "- Given that epsilon is a measure of resource scarcity, it's a great way to price the difference between two queries. Intuitively, if a seller of data has 10 queries against their data to consider, and one of those queries could be used to restore the entire dataset, then the price of that query must exceed the price of the other 9 queries combined in order for that query to be answered first. Of course, if the seller of data has reason to believe that no further queries will come, then selling to the 10th buyer becomes more reasonable. \n",
    "- The epsilon also can be used to measure the risk that an individual's identity will be revealed as being in the data. Risk should be priced, which is why this measure matters.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the metric which creates a liquid market for insights. If you can answer the question using less sensitive/scarce/valuable data, you'll be financially incentivised to do so because of the scarcity constraints mentioned above.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Certifications (certs)\n",
    "\n",
    "A perennial problem with working with data you cannot see - how do you know it is real? The next set of columns seeks to address this.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Validity Certifications\n",
    "\n",
    "These certifications are certifications of entities who claim to have \"seen the data\". Registered users of the domain are able to receive signed hashes of the dataset, signed using the private keys of well-known brands (such as major hospitals, etc.). The primary utility here is that data can be hosted by domains/networks on behalf of others, but still retain the \"stamp\" from the original creators of the data that \"this is something I endorse\". \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the dataset from \"Doctor's Direct\" doesn't have any good certifications - this dataset should be considered suspect.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### User Certifications\n",
    "\n",
    "This type of certification is basically a form of dataset reviews. Individuals have the ability to report the ranking of datasets within their experiment, meaning a ranking of \"which dataset was most predictive for my task, second most predictive, etc.\". The metric \"avg_user_cert_ranking\" is a measure of the average \"top percentage\" that a dataset took across all tasks it's been used for. So a score of \"5%\" would be quite good, it would mean that a dataset ranked in the top 5% of all datasets for that task. (This can be measured using cross validation.) Note that
each ranking is signed by the user's private key along with some cryptographic material which only users of the dataset receive (issued by the domain owner before experimentation begins).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the dataset from \"Doctor's Direct\" has a pretty bad user score. I'll bet this dataset is (probably) fake.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Schema\n",
    "\n",
    "Farther to the right in the table, you'll see the \"schema\" column. This is an extremely useful column wherein datasets can put forward the name of the schema the dataset is formatted in. This allows multiple datasets to subscribe to the same schema which makes federated learning easier. Note further that if you go through the trouble to format N datasets into a single schema for training, you can sell this transformation back to the data owners as a new dataset. It makes their data more valuable to be transformed into uniform/popular schemas.\n",
    "\n",

They exist explicitly because the domain owner might be dishonest. In particular, it is possible that the domain owner might lie about the kinds of data he/she has. Thus, each certificate is a \"signed statement\" by a third party claiming something about the dataset. What kinds of claims are made?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Validity Certs: these certificates exist to all say the same thing, namely that, \"I, (certificate author) have seen the dataset and testify that it is genuine, namely that the rest of the metadata on the dataset object is true.\". Validity certificates may also be accompanied by contracts which are binding in one or more legal jurisdictions, further adding weight to the claims. Note that the Domain owner may host these certificates themself because they are exclusively endorsements of the dataset, thus the domain owner has incentive to broadcast them. An important question to ask at this point is, \"can the domain owner forge certificates?\". The answer is yes and no. Yes, they can add as many certificates as they want to the list. However, each certificate is only as good as it's \"signature\". Much like in the real world, a signature is a symbol which only a specific individual could make. On paper, we have people use a pen and ink. In a data structure, we have people use a \"cryptographic signature\". In this way, a certificate is only useful if it is signed by someone who is known to be credible. \"Credibility\" in this case is usually associated with whether or not the individual has something to lose if they lose their reputation - aka, they're probably in the business of disseminating data and if word got out that they were disseminating fake data they would lose their shirt. The final important question you should ask is, \"how do I know if a signature came from a specific person?\". We will cover this later.\n",
    "\n",
    "- User Certs: these certificates are like Validity certificates except that:\n",
    "    - They aren't just endorsements of the data. They can also be negative (claims that the data is un-useful).\n",
    "    - Because they can be negative, they must have alternative sources to \"host\" them, typically the network (by default), but they can also be other domains (who have a competitive reason to hold their competitors accountable) or other network nodes. The preferred storage is a mix between the dataset's domain holder and other domain holders because they are maximally incentivized to hold positive/negative user certs respectively.\n",
    "    - These certificates come in several types:\n",
    "        - Cross val rank certificates: these certificates basically say, \"I trained on this dataset using federated learning, but before averaging all the models together, I created a set of cross validation scores, one score for each dataset which was with-held from the model average. This allowed me to rank the datasets by their relative contribution to the overall accuracy. On average, this dataset was in the top X% of datasets for my task on dataset schema Y\".\n",
    "        - Holdout accuracy certificates: I trained on this dataset exclusively and got a holdout score using X test dataset of Y.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Provenance Certificates: these are claims or cryptographic proofs about where a particular dataset comes from.\n",
    "    - Provenance Claim Certs: structured similarly to the user and validity certificates, this is merely a claim that a dataset originates from a particular transformation (such as a model) on another dataset.\n",
    "    - Provenance Verified Computation Certs: a different kind of certificate which provides cryptographic proof that a dataset was created using one or more others passed through a specific function. This is computationally more intensive than Provenance Claim Certs, but in the right context they can lend very strong credibility to the claim.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Arbitrary Certs: these are simply signed strings attached to the dataset. They can say anything, although they do have a \"type\" field which can allow for standards to emerge if a specific kind of certificate is deemed useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, now that we have an intuition for what these certificates exist to do, we can consider how we might use them in a search query to find high-quality datasets."
