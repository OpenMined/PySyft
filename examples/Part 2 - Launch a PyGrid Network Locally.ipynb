    "# Part 2: Launch a Grid Network Locally\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you'll learn how to deploy a grid network into a local machine and then interact with it using PySyft.\n",
    "\n",
    "_WARNING: Grid nodes publish datasets online and are for EXPERIMENTAL use only. Deploy nodes at your own risk. Do not use OpenGrid with any data/models you wish to keep private._\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to run an grid network locally you will need to run two different apps: a grid gateway and one or more grid workers. In this tutorial we will use the websocket app available [here](https://github.com/OpenMined/PyGrid/tree/dev/app/websocket) to start the grid workers.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Starting the Grid Gateway\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Download the repository\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git clone https://github.com/OpenMined/PyGrid/\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Download dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll need to have the app dependencies installed. We recommend setting up an independent [conda environment](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/concepts/environments.html) to avoid problems with library versions.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can install the dependencies by running:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "cd PyGrid/gateway/\n",
    "pip install -r requirements.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Start gateway app\n",
    "\n",
    "Then to start the app just run the `gateway.py` script. The `--start_local_db` automatically starts a local database so you don't have to configure one yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python gateway.py --start_local_db --port=<port_number>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will start the app on address: `http://0.0.0.0/<port_number>`.\n",
    "\n",
    "To check what other arguments you can use when running this app, run:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python gateway.py --help\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start a grid gateway on port `5000`\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python gateway.py --port=5000\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Great, so if your app started successfully the script should still be running.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Starting the Grid Worker App\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Starting the Grid Worker app\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the same procedure already described at Part 1. But we add a new argument when starting the app called `--gateway_url` this should equal to the address used by the grid network here it's \"http://localhost:5000\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start two workers:\n",
    "\n",
    "* bob on port `3000`\n",
    "* alice on port `3001`\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python websocket_app.py --db_url=redis:///redis:6379 --id=bob --port=3000 --gateway_url=http://localhost:5000\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python websocket_app.py --db_url=redis:///redis:6379 --id=alice --port=3001 --gateway_url=http://localhost:5000\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We should always start the workers after starting the grid gateway!!\n",
    "\n",
    "Great, so if your app started successfully the script should still be running.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 5: Start communication with the Grid Gateway and workers\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start communication with the Gateway and the workers."
