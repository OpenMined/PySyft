    "SMPC is at first glance a rather strange form of \"encryption\". Instead of using a public/private key to encrypt a variable, each value is split into multiple \"shares\", each of which operate like a private key. Typically, these \"shares\" will be distributed amongst 2 or more \"owners\". Thus, in order to decrypt the variable, all owners must agree to allow the decryption. In essence, everyone has a private key.\n",
