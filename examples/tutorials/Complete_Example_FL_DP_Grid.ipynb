    "# Train an Image-Classifier using Federated Learning with Differential Privacy\n",
    "## A complete End-to-End Real World Example - PySyft, PyGrid\n",
    "* This tutorial aims at demonstrating a high level of privacy using **Secured Federated Learning** and **Differential Privacy based on the Laplace-Mechanism** as part of the **PATE framework**. To tackle a problem similair to a real-world-problem, yet still using a well explored example (the privacy tools are of main interest in this tutorial) it was chosen to train an Image-Classifier on the **[Cifar-10 dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html)**. In the [original paper on the PATE framework](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.05755.pdf), simpler problems such as training a classifier on MNIST and SVHN were tackled.\n",
    "* Containing 60000 32x32 pixels coloured images of 10 different classes (airplanes, birds, etc.) this should showcase a reasonably similair task to another real-world example such as the training of a classifier for skin-cancer-classification, which heavily relies on sensitive private data. See [Stanford's Skin Cancer Classification with Deep Learning](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/esteva/nature/) for more information on this specific example.\n",
    "* To be able to give a complete end-to-end example the goal is to also use PyGrid to build a peer-to-peer network which should be used as basis for a coordination of the workers. \n",
    "* Besides a tutorial this should also serve as good testing ground for the *\"production-readyness\"* of PySyft and PyGrid. (Speed, Accuracy, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Specific Situation - Real-World-Scenario: \n",
    "To make the example as close to a real world production use-case and to best give a quick overview over the PATE framework for DP along with FL, we define a simple usecase along three different parties taking part in this setup. <br>\n",
    "**We will assume the role of the model provider who also coordinates the procedure given the following parties.** One can imagine that requests from both model providers and data providers can lead to the initiation of the proecss given a neutral party which coordinates the procedure in the future (See *Shortcomings* Section)\n",
    "  1. **Data Provider:** Owns personal sensitive data. **E.g.:** in this case some photographers who all made pictures of some objects in real life and sorted them (into the ten classes for this examle). His/her goal is to either *create/train a classifier* which automates the sorting of the images for him/her or to *participate in creating a general image classifier which can recognize objects on images in general*. Possibly he/she also wants somebody to *host the classifier to speed up inference time*. \n",
    "  2. **Model Provider:** Creates the model, in this case the classifier-model. His/her goal is to use his model-architecture and train it on the photographers (Data Provider) personal data and to then make this trained model available to a broad range of user. \n",
    "  3. **Hosting Provider:** Provides computing ressources along possible hosting capabilities. His/her goal is to provide the Data and Model Provider with the neccessary computing power for training and hosting capabilities for deployment. \n",
    "  * **How is this example representative for the need/usage of privacy preserving ML?**\n",
    "    This example portrays some of the key characteristics of privacy-preserving ML. \n",
    "      * **Combining Knowledge:** A single photographer wouldn't provide enough data to train a good image classifier and wouldn't have the knowledge to build a classifier. Together with different other (possibly even competing photographers) and a model provider he can train a good model together with the other parties. \n",
    "      * **Federated Learning:** He doesn't want his sorted photographs to be accessable by either the other competing photographers or the model creator. (He wants to sell his photographs)\n",
    "      * **Differential Privacy:** Classifiers as ML-Models in general can memorize specific parts of the training data, making it possible to retrieve information about the training data (or even parts of some datapoints). In this case the photographer doesn't want users of the classifier (e.g.: the competing photographers) to be able to retrieve information about his unique way of photograhping (e.g.: key motives, etc.)  \n",
    "      * *All the above points are also exactly the critical points when trainng a classifier e.g. on a skin-cancer dataset.*\n",

    "# The PATE Framework\n",
    "## The assumptions \n",
    "Introduced in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.05755.pdf) the *Private Aggregation of Teacher\n",
    "Ensembles* (PATE) framework consists of the following basic setup. <br>\n",
    "**Before:** It is important to note that the PATE framework assumes a certain situation: \n",
    "* **Discrete Model Output:** The PATE framework (acoording to the original paper) assumes that a model should be trained that has a discrete output i.e. it categorizes or classifies some input into categories. In this case this is an image-classifier. \n",
    "* **Data structure:** The PATE framework assumes that the following data exists and is stored in the following way:\n",
    "  * **Private Data:** The private data is stored on multiple workers (photographers here) The private data is *labeled* and each worker has *different datapoints* (different photographs). Furthermore the private data isn't sufficient to train a good classifier alone.  \n",
    "  * **Public Data:** In addition to the private data PATE assumes that there exists a second larger dataset of *unlabeled, public and unsensitive* images. In this case for example this could be very large database of pictures from various newspapers. They aren't labeled and everybody can access them since the newspapers decided to share them (e.g.: they don't sell them directly)\n",
    "* **Semi-Supervised Learning:** Given the particular datasets that are given PATE assumes that we want to leverage smaller labeled datasets (normally used for supervised learning) together with an unlabeled dataset (normally used for unsupervised learning) to train a final model, meaning we want to train it using semi-supervised learning. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## The procedure\n",
    "(For more info see in the learning material section above, notably Andrew Trask's tutorial) <br>\n",
    "This image shows an overview over the procedure: (from the [the original paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.05755.pdf))\n",
    "<img src=\"./material/PATE_framework_overview_from_paper.png\" width=\"600\">\n",
    "\n",
    "1. STEP: **Multiple Teacher-Models are trained on each of the private datasets**\n",
    "  * This is also where we want to use **Federated Learning** to not *directly* access the data at all. To make sure that the photographers don't see the model of the model provider (he/she sells that) we'll be encrypting both the model and the data via Additive Secret Sharing using Secure Multi-Party Computing (SMPC). \n",
    "2. STEP: **For each unlabeled datapoint in the public dataset teacher-models jointly predict a label**\n",
    "  * This is where noise is added for **Differential Privacy**. \n",
    "3. STEP: **One Student-Model is trained on the newly labeled public dataset**\n",
    "  * This is where **the final model** is created. "

    "#  Setting Up (No Grid yet)  !CHECK NEEDED!\n",
    "## Motivation/Explanation of the approach for the PATE Setup \n",
    "Ideally we would like to initiate a PATE procedure which is coordinated completely automatically given some existing workers (which could be searched for with the grid infrastructure) To achieve that we would need to assume the role of a neutral party which can remotely coordinate the process. <br> \n",
    "To date certain features don't exist to fully coordinate everything coordinately:  (more in *Shortcomings*) \n",
    "* ReLUs, Maxpool, etc. which are one of the most used functions in DNNs can only be computed encrypted on **2 workers** (based on the current implementation of the crypto-protocls [secureNN](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/securenn-efficient-and-private-neural-network-training/) and the SPDZ protocol for adding, mm)\n",
    "* There is no possibility to `remote_share()` remotely encrypted a tensor which is stored on another machine. <br>(***TODO: Check if solvable***)\n",
    "For setting up the PATE-Scenario as described above we assume that the data from the data providers and the model from the model provider are distributed for encryption (SMPC) <br>\n",
    "Despite the given constraints the goal is to make the PATE procedure as realistic as possible: \n",
    "* For SMPC **\"Hosting Groups\"** consisting of 2 workers are created, one for each teacher. The idea is that only one hosting_group consisting of 2 workers is not powerful enough to host the potentially parallel (goal for the future) training of all the different teacher-models. To guarantee that the two workers don't work together for decryption of either the model or some dataset all the groups consist of a teacher (with his dataset) and the student. <br> In the future the goal is to dynamically host additional neutral workers from a third-party provider to support the computation if necessary. \n",
    "* *For now* the training of the student-models and the labeling of the student dataset through the noisy voting process happen both in **sequential order** \n",
    "* *For now* **no plans or protocols** were implemented for further automation of the procedure, because no alternative for a remote encryption (remote-share) was found. This would be needed e.g. to move the public dataset from hosting group to hosting group automatically to gather the teacher predictions (remote_share() from model provider, after first prediction remote_get() and again remote_share to next hosting group)\n",
    "    * Nevertheless **the future goal** is to be able to create a completely automated PATE-protocol which only needs to be provided with the participating parties. (teachers, students + *dynamic task-based number of external hosting-workers* )\n",
    "* *For now* **usage of the grid** (actual workers with a Public or Private Grid) as an added first step for finding of the correct workers to initiate a PATE-procedure. Whith the search functionality data-tags can be searched for and the corresponding workers (potential teachers) can be found (location attribute) The remaining procedure stays the same as with VirtualWorkers and without gateway.
