    "When building Machine Learning as a Service solutions (MLaaS), a company might need to request access to data from other partners to train its model. In health or in finance, both the model and the data are extremely critical: the model parameters is a business asset while data is personal data which is tightly regulated.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this context, one possible solution is to encrypt both the model and the data and to train the machine learning model over the encrypted values. This guarantees that the company won't access patients medical records for example and that health facilities won't be able to observe the model to which they contribute. Several encryption schemes exist that allow for computation over encrypted data, among which Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC), Homomorphic Encryption (FHE/SHE) and Functional Encryption (FE). We will focus here on Multi-Party Computation (which have been introduced in Tutorial 5) which consists of private additive sharing and relies on the crypto protocols SecureNN and SPDZ.\n",
    "\n",
    "The exact setting of this tutorial is the following: consider that you are the server and you would like to train your model on some data held by $n$ workers. The server secret shares his model and send each share to a worker. The workers also secret share their data and exchange it between them. In the configuration that we will study, there are 2 workers: alice and bob. After exchanging shares, each of them now has one of their own shares, one share of the other worker, and one share of the model. Computation can now start to privately train the model using the appropriate crypto protocols. Once the model is trained, all the shares can be sent back to the server to decrypt it. This is illustrated with the following figure:"

Security against malicious adversaries in such SMPC computations including private comparison is still an open problem.\n",

    "In addition, even if Secure Multi-Party Computation ensures that training data wasn't accessed, many threats from the plain text world are still present here. For example, as you can make request to the model (in the context of MLaaS), you can get predictions which might disclose information about the training dataset. In particular you don't have any protection against membership attacks, a common attack on machine learning services where the adversary wants to determine if a specific item was used in the dataset. Besides this, other attacks such as unintended memorization processes (models learning specific feature about a data item), model inversion or extraction are still possible.\n",
