    "SMPC is at first glance a rather strange form of \"encryption\". Instead of using a public/private key to encrypt a variable, each value is split into multiple `shares`, each of which operate like a private key. Typically, these `shares` will be distributed amongst 2 or more _owners_. Thus, in order to decrypt the variable, all owners must agree to allow the decryption. In essence, everyone has a private key.\n",

    "So, let's say we wanted to \"encrypt\" a variable `x`, we could do so in the following way.\n",
    "\n",
    " > Encryption doesn't use floats or real numbers but happens in a mathematical space called [integer quotient ring](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/QuotientRing.html) which is basically the integers between `0` and `Q-1`, where `Q` is prime and \"big enough\" so that the space can contain all the numbers that we use in our experiments. In practice, given a value `x` integer, we do `x % Q` to fit in the ring. (That's why we avoid using number `x' > Q`)."
