    "# Part  1 - Introduction to Grid\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Grid is a platform to **train**, **share** and **manage** models and datasets in a **distributed**, **collaborative** and **secure way**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;    Grid platform aims to be a secure peer to peer platform. It was created to use pysyft's features to perform federated learning processes without the need to manage distributed workers directly. Nowadays, to perform machine learning process with PySyft library, the user needs to manage directly all the workers' stuff (start nodes, manage node connections, turn off nodes, etc). Grid platform solves this in a transparent way. The user won't need to know about how the nodes are connected or where is some specific dataset.  \n",

    "## Why should we use grid?\n",
    "As mentioned before, the grid is basically a platform that uses PySyft library to manage distributed workers providing some special features.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**We should use grid to:**\n",
    "- Train models using datasets that we've never seen (without getting access to its real values).\n",
    "- Train a model with encrypted datasets.\n",
    "- Provide Secure MLaaS running encrypted model inferences across grid network.\n",
    "- We can serve an encrypted model without giving its real weights to anyone.\n",
    "- We can run encrypted inferences without sending our private data to anyone.\n",
    "- Mitigate risks and impacts using Federated Learning's **\"privacy by design\"** property.\n",
    "- Manage the privacy level of datasets stored at grid network allowing/disallowing access to them.\n"

    "### Private Grid\n",
    "###### Private Grid is used to build private's grid platform.\n",
    "&nbsp; It will empower you with the control to manage the entire platform, you'll be able to create, remove and manage all nodes connected on your grid network. However, with power and control, you'll need to take care of the grid platform by yourself. \n",
    "\n",
    "- To build it, you'll need to know previously where is each grid node that you want to use in your infrastructure.\n",
    "- You will need to configure scale up/scale down routines (nº of nodes) by yourself.\n",
    "- You can add pr remove nodes.\n",
    "- You will be connected directly with these nodes.\n",

    "###### Public Grid offers the oportunity to work as a real collaborative platform.  \n",
    "&nbsp;Unlike the private grid, anyone has the power to control all nodes connected to the public grid, the platform will be managed by grid gateway. This component will update the network automatically and perform queries through the nodes. It's important to note that the grid gateway can **only perform non-privileged commands** on grid nodes, it will avoid some vulnerabilities. \n",
    "\n",

    "    - We send pointers to datasets instead of real datasets.\n",
    "    - We can share our models across the network in an encrypted way.\n",
    "    - We can run inferences using our sensitive datasets without send the real value of it to anyone.\n",
