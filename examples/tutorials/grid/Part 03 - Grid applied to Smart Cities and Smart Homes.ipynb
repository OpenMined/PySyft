    "# Grid applied to Smart Cities and Smart Homes\n",
    "\n",
    "As we know, smart cities and smart homes are new concepts emerging on computer science field. Theses concepts aims to automate city/home services by data evaluation to take decisions based on local citizien behavior improving their life quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of these concepts that we can apply on our example purpose are [**Smart Grids**](https://www.smartgrid.gov/the_smart_grid/smart_grid.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Smart Grid\n",
    "&nbsp;The Smart Grid represents an unprecedented opportunity to move the energy industry into a new era of reliability, availability, and efficiency that will contribute to our economic and environmental health.The benefits associated with the Smart Grid include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- More efficient transmission of electricity\n",
    "- Quicker restoration of electricity after power disturbances\n",
    "- Reduced operations and management costs for utilities, and ultimately lower power costs for consumers\n",
    "- Reduced peak demand, which will also help lower electricity rates\n",
    "- Increased integration of large-scale renewable energy systems\n",
    "- Better integration of customer-owner power generation systems, including renewable energy systems\n",
    "- Improved security\n",
    "\n",
    "The Smart Grid will consist of millions of pieces and parts—controls, computers, power lines, and new technologies and equipment. One of the most important component on Smart Grid infrastructure are **Smart Meters**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Smart Meters\n",
    "&nbsp;Smart meters provide the Smart Grid interface between you and your energy provider. For instance, smart meters will deliver signals from your energy provider that can help you cut your energy costs. Smart meters also provide utilities with greater information about how much electricity is being used throughout their service areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;This energy information coming to and from your home through your smart meter can be run through a home energy management System (EMS), which will allow you to view it in an easy-to-understand format on your computer or hand-held device. A home EMS allows you to track your energy use in detail to better save energy. For instance, you can see the energy impact of various appliances and electronic products simply by monitoring your EMS while switching the devices on and off.\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;An EMS also allows you to monitor real-time information and price signals from your utility and create settings to automatically use power when prices are lowest. You can also choose settings that allow specific appliances and equipment to turn off automatically when a large demand threatens to cause an outage—avoiding peak demand rates, helping to balance the energy load in your area, and preventing blackouts. Your utility may provide financial incentives for doing so.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Privacy Preserving problems\n",
    "As mentioned before, in the smart grid structure, smart meters send costumer's data to the energy provider.It creates threats in user's privacy.  \n",
    "As argued in [Cyber Attack Impact on Critical Smart Grid Infrastructures](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/260301409_Cyber_Attack_Impact_on_Critical_Smart_Grid_Infrastructures): \n",
    "<em>\"The  basic  concern  about  consumer  threats  is  privacy \n",
    "violation. Sensitive consumer data such as name, address, and \n",
    "social security number, could be transmitted via Smart Meters \n",
    "which may be an attractive target for attackers. Smart Meters \n",
    "also  handle  consumers’  history,  information  depicting  their \n",
    "presence,  individual  preferences,  social  activities, \n",
    "consumption  habits,  as  well  as  health issues.  Such \n",
    "information could be exploited for various purposes, with the \n",
    "advertising case to seem the most innocent among others.\"</em>"
