    "### What is Federated Learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "It's a simple, powerful way to train Deep Learning models. If you think about training data, it's always the result of some sort of collection process. People (via devices) generate data by recording events in the real world. Normally, this data is aggregated to a single, central location so that you can train a machine learning model. Federated Learning turns this on its head!\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of bringing training data to the model (a central server), you bring the model to the training data (wherever it may live).\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is that this allows whoever is creating the data to own the only permanent copy, and thus maintain control over who ever has access to it. Pretty cool, eh?"

    "\n",
    "And voilà! We now are training a very simple Deep Learning model using Federated Learning! We send the model to each worker, generate a new gradient, and then bring the gradient back to our local server where we update our global model. Never in this process do we ever see or request access to the underlying training data! We preserve the privacy of Bob and Alice!!!\n",

    "\n",
    "So, while this example is a nice introduction to Federated Learning, it still has some major shortcomings. Most notably, when we call `model.get()` and receive the updated model from Bob or Alice, we can actually learn a lot about Bob and Alice's training data by looking at their gradients. In some cases, we can restore their training data perfectly! \n",
    "\n",
    "So, what is there to do? Well, the first strategy people employ is to **average the gradient across multiple individuals before uploading it to the central server**. This strategy, however, will require some more sophisticated use of PointerTensor objects. So, in the next section, we're going to take some time to learn about more advanced pointer functionality and then we'll upgrade this Federated Learning example\n"
