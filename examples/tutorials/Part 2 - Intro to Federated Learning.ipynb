    "In the last section, we learned about PointerTensors, which create the underlying infrastructure we need for privacy preserving Deep Learning. In this section, we're going to see how to use these basic tools to implement our first privacy preserving deep learning algorithm, Federated Learning.\n",

    "### What is Federated Learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "It's a simple, powerful way to train Deep Learning models. If you think about training data, it's always the result of some sort of collection process. People (via devices) generate data by recording events in the real world. Normally, this data is aggregated to a single, central location so that you can train a machine learning model. Federated Learning turns this on its head!\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of bringing training data to the model (a central server), you bring the model to the training data (wherever it may live).\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is that this allows whoever is creating the data to own the only permanent copy, and thus maintain control over who ever has access to it. Pretty cool, eh?"

We send the model to each worker, generate a new gradient, and then bring the gradient back to our local server where we update our global model. Never in this process do we ever see or request access to the underlying training data! We preserve the privacy of Bob and Alice!!!\n",

In some cases, we can restore their training data perfectly! \n",

This strategy, however, will require some more sophisticated use of PointerTenor objects.
