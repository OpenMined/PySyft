    "Welcome to this tutorial! In the following notebooks you will learn how to provide private predictions. By private predictions, we mean that the data is constantly encrypted throughout the entire process. At no point is the user sharing raw data, only encrypted (that is, secret shared) data. In order to provide these private predictions, Syft Keras uses a library called [TF Encrypted](https://github.com/tf-encrypted/tf-encrypted) under the hood. TF Encrypted combines cutting-edge cryptographic and machine learning techniques, but you don't have to worry about this and can focus on your machine learning application.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can start serving private predictions with only three steps:\n",
    "- **Step 1**: train your model with normal Keras.\n",
    "- **Step 2**: secure and serve your machine learning model (server).\n",
    "- **Step 3**: query the secured model to receive private predictions (client). \n",
    "\n",
    "Alright, let's go through these three steps so you can deploy impactful machine learning services without sacrificing user privacy or model security.\n",

    "To use privacy-preserving machine learning techniques for your projects you should not have to learn a new machine learning framework. If you have basic [Keras](https://keras.io/) knowledge, you can start using these techniques with Syft Keras. If you have never used Keras before, you can learn a bit more about it through the [Keras documentation](https://keras.io). \n",

    "Before serving private predictions, the first step is to train your model with normal Keras. As an example, we will train a model to classify handwritten digits. To train this model we will use the canonical [MNIST dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/).\n",
