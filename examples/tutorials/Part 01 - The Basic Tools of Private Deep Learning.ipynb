    "# Tutorial: The Basic Tools of Private Deep Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to PySyft's introductory tutorial for privacy preserving, decentralized deep learning. This series of notebooks is a step-by-step guide for you to get to know the new tools and techniques required for doing deep learning on secret/private data/models without centralizing them under one authority.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scope:** Note that we'll not just be talking about how to decentralized / encrypt data, but we'll be addressing how PySyft can be used to help decentralize the entire ecosystem around data, even including the Databases where data is stored and queried, and the neural models which are used to extract information from data. As new extensions to PySyft are created, these notebooks will be extended with new tutorials to explain the new functionality.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Why Take This Tutorial?\n",
    "\n",
    "**1) A Competitive Career Advantage** - For the past 20 years, the digital revolution has made data more and more accessible in ever larger quantities as analog processes have become digitized. However, with new regulation such as [GDPR](https://eugdpr.org/), enterprises are under pressure to have less freedom with how they use - and more importantly how they analyze - personal information. **Bottom Line:** Data Scientists aren't going to have access to as much data with \"old school\" tools, but by learning the tools of Private Deep Learning, YOU can be ahead of this curve and have a competitive advantage in your career. \n",
    "\n",
    "**2) Entrepreneurial Opportunities** - There are a whole host of problems in society that Deep Learning can solve, but many of the most important haven't been explored because it would require access to incredibly sensitive information about people (consider using Deep Learning to help people with mental or relationship issues!). Thus, learning Private Deep Learning unlocks a whole host of new startup opportunities for you which were not previously available to others without these toolsets.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3) Social Good** - Deep Learning can be used to solve a wide variety of problems in the real world, but Deep Learning on *personal information* is Deep Learning about people, *for people*. Learning how to do Deep Learning on data you don't own represents more than a career or entrepreneurial opportunity, it is the opportunity to help solve some of the most personal and important problems in people's lives - and to do it at scale.\n",
