    "# Introduction to Promises and PromiseTensors\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Context \n",
    "\n",
    "We introduce here Promises and, more specificly, PromiseTensors. The principle is quite similar to promises or futures that you may have encountered in some programming languages as Javascript. As stated in wikipedia, \"they describe an object that acts as a proxy for a result that is initially unknown, usually because the computation of its value is not yet complete.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, we will explore PromiseTensors which inherit from the Promise class and are used when the object that is waited for is a torch tensor. \n",
    "\n",
