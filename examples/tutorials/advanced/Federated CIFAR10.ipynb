    "On the security side it still has some major shortcomings. Most notably, when we call `model.get()` and receive the updated model from Bob or Alice, we can actually learn a lot about Bob and Alice's training data by looking at their gradients. We could **average the gradient across multiple individuals before uploading it to the central server**, like we did in Part 4 of tutorials section."
