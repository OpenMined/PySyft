    "Thanks to this, you were able to train spam detector model without having any access to the remote and private data: for each batch you sent the model to the current remote worker and got it back to the local machine before sending it to the worker of the next batch.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also notice that this federated training did not harm the performance of the model as both losses reduced at each epoch as expected and the final AUC score on the test data was above 97.5%.\n",

    "There is however one limitation of this method: by getting the model back we can still have access to some private information. \n",
