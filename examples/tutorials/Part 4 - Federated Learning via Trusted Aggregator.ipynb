    "# Part 4: Federated Learning with Model Averaging\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recap:** In Part 2 of this tutorial, we trained a model using a very simple version of Federated Learning. This required each data owner to trust the model owner to be able to see their gradients.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Description:** In this tutorial, we'll show how to use the advanced aggregation tools from Part 3 to allow the weights to be aggregated by a trusted \\\"secure worker\\\" before the final resulting model is sent back to the model owner (us). \n",
    "\n",
    "In this way, only the secure worker can see whose weights came from whom. We might be able to tell which parts of the model changed, but we do NOT know which worker (bob or alice) made which change, which creates a layer of privacy.\n",
