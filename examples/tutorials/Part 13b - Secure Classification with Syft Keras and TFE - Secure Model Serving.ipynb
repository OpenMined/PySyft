    "Now that you have a trained model with normal Keras, you are ready to serve some private predictions. We can do that using Syft Keras.\n",
    "\n",
    "To secure and serve this model, we will need three TFEWorkers (servers). This is because TF Encrypted under the hood uses an encryption technique called [multi-party computation (MPC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_multi-party_computation). The idea is to split the model weights and input data into shares, then send a share of each value to the different servers. The key property is that if you look at the share on one server, it reveals nothing about the original value (input data or model weights).\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll define a Syft Keras model like we did in the previous notebook. However, there is a trick: before instantiating this model, we'll run `hook = sy.KerasHook(tf.keras)`. This will add three important new methods to the Keras Sequential class:\n",
    " - `share`: will secure your model via secret sharing; by default, it will use the SecureNN protocol from TF Encrypted to secret share your model between each of the three TFEWorkers. Most importantly, this will add the capability of providing predictions on encrypted data.\n",
    " - `serve`: this function will launch a serving queue, so that the TFEWorkers can accept prediction requests on the secured model from external clients.\n",
    " - `shutdown_workers`: once you are done providing private predictions, you can shut down your model by running this function. It will direct you to shutdown the server processes manually if you've opted to manually manage each worker.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to learn more about MPC, you can read this excellent [blog](https://mortendahl.github.io/2017/04/17/private-deep-learning-with-mpc/)."
