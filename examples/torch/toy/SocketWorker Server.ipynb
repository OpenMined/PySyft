    "# Socket Worker Server Tutorial\n",

    "In this tutorial, we'll demonstrate how to launch a SocketWorker server which will listen for PyTorch commands over a socket connection. This tutorial is a followup to the VirtualWorker tutorial (https://github.com/OpenMined/PySyft/blob/master/examples/Remote%20PyTorch%20using%20Virtual%20Worker.ipynb) where the only difference is that in this tutorial the two workers are connected via a socket connection on the localhost network.\n",
