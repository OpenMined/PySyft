# _Versioning scheme:_
# The major and minor version of each release correspond to the supported
# IPFS daemon version. The revision number will be updated whenever we make
# a new release for the `py-ipfs-api` client for that daemon version.
#
# Example: The first client version to support the `0.4.x`-series of the IPFS
# HTTP API will have version `0.4.0`, the second version will have version
# `0.4.1` and so on. When IPFS `0.5.0` is released, the first client version
# to support it will also be released as `0.5.0`.

__version__ = "0.4.2"
