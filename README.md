PySyft is a Python library for secure and private Deep Learning. PySyft decouples
private data from model training, using
[Federated Learning](https://ai.googleblog.com/2017/04/federated-learning-collaborative.html),
[Differential Privacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_privacy),
and Encrypted Computation (like
[Multi-Party Computation (MPC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_multi-party_computation)
and  [Homomorphic Encryption (HE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homomorphic_encryption)
within the main Deep Learning frameworks like PyTorch and TensorFlow. Join the movement on

## FAQ 0.2.x ➡️ 0.3.x
We have compiled a list of [FAQs](docs/FAQ_0.2.x.md) relating to the change from 0.2.x to 0.3.x+ [here](docs/FAQ_0.2.x.md).

_**Important note about PySyft 0.2.x:** The PySyft 0.2.x codebase is now in its own branch [here](https://github.com/OpenMined/PySyft/tree/syft_0.2.x), but OpenMined will not offer official support for this version range. If you're getting started with PySyft for the first time, please ignore this message and read on!_

## PySyft in Detail

A more detailed explanation of PySyft can be found in the
[white paper on Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.04017).

PySyft has also been explained in videos on YouTube:
 - [PriCon Sep 2020 Duet Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DppXfA6C8L8&ab_channel=OpenMined)
 - [Introduction to Privacy-Preserving AI using PySyft by @iamtrask](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJBBE_SN90A)
 - [Introduction to PySyft codebase by @andreiliphd](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Zw08_4ufHw)

## Pre-Installation

PySyft is available on PyPI and Conda.

We recommend that you install PySyft within a virtual environment like
[Conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/overview.html),
due to its ease of use. If you are using Windows, we suggest installing
[Anaconda and using the Anaconda
Prompt](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/user-guide/getting-started/) to
work from the command line.

```bash
$ conda create -n pysyft python=3.8
$ conda activate pysyft
$ conda install jupyter notebook
```

## Version Support

We support **Linux**, **MacOS** and **Windows** and the following Python and Torch versions.

Python | Torch 1.5 | Torch 1.6 | Torch 1.7
--- | --- | --- | ---
3.6 | ✅ | ✅ | ✅
3.7 | ✅ | ✅ | ✅
3.8 | ✅ | ✅ | ✅

## Installation

### Pip
```bash
$ pip install syft
```

This will auto-install PyTorch and other dependencies as required, to run the
examples and tutorials. For more information on building from source see the contribution guide [here](https://github.com/OpenMined/PySyft/tree/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Documentation
The latest official documentation is hosted here: [https://pysyft.readthedocs.io/](https://pysyft.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html#)

## Duet Examples

All the examples can be played with by launching Jupyter Notebook and navigating to
the examples/duet folder.

```bash
$ jupyter notebook
```

## WebRTC Signaling Server
To facilitate peer-to-peer connections through firewalls we utilise WebRTC and a
signaling server. After connection, no traffic is sent to this server.

If you want to run your own signaling server simply run the command:
```
$ syft-network
```

Then update your duet notebooks to use the new `network_url=http://localhost:5000`

## Try out the Tutorials

A comprehensive list of Duet Examples can be found
[here](https://github.com/OpenMined/PySyft/tree/master/examples/duet)

These tutorials cover how to operate common network types over the Duet API.

## Description
Most software libraries let you compute over the information you own and see inside of
machines you control. However, this means that you cannot compute on information without
first obtaining (at least partial) ownership of that information. It also means that you
cannot compute using machines without first obtaining control over those machines.
This is very limiting to human collaboration in all areas of life and systematically
drives the centralization of data, because you cannot work with a bunch of data without
first putting it all in one (central) place.

The Syft ecosystem seeks to change this system, allowing you to write software which can
compute over information you do not own on machines you do not have (general) control
over. This not only includes servers in the cloud, but also personal desktops, laptops,
mobile phones, websites, and edge devices. Wherever your data wants to live in your
ownership, the Syft ecosystem exists to help keep it there while allowing it to be
used for computation.

This library is the centerpiece of the Syft ecosystem. It has two primary purposes.
You can either use PySyft to:

1) *Dynamic:* Directly compute over data you cannot see.
2) *Static:* Create static graphs of computation which can be deployed/scaled at a
later date on different compute.

The Syft ecosystem includes libraries which allow for communication with and computation
over a variety of runtimes:

- KotlinSyft (Android)
- SwiftSyft (iOS)
- syft.js (Web & Mobile)
- PySyft (Python)

However, the Syft ecosystem only focuses on consistent object
serialization/deserialization, core abstractions, and algorithm design/execution across
these languages. These libraries alone will not connect you with data in the real world.
The Syft ecosystem is supported by the Grid ecosystem, which focuses on the deployment,
scalability, and other additional concerns around running real-world systems to compute
over and process data (such as data compliance web applications).

Syft is the library that defines objects, abstractions, and algorithms.
Grid is the platform which lets you deploy them within a real institution
(or on the open internet, but we don't yet recommend this). The Grid ecosystem includes:

- GridNetwork - think of this like DNS for private data.
  It helps you find remote data assets so that you can compute on them.
- PyGrid - This is the gateway to an organization's data, responsible for permissions,
  load balancing, and governance.
- GridNode - This is an individual node within an organization's data center,
  running executions requested by external parties.
- GridMonitor - This is a UI which allows an institution to introspect and control
  their PyGrid node and the GridNodes it manages.
