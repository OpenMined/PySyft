> Homomorphically Encrypted Deep Learning Library

The goal of this library is to give the user the ability to efficiently train Deep Learning models in a homomorphically encrypted state without needing to be an expert in either. Furthermore, by understanding the characteristics of both Deep Learning and Homomorphic Encryption, we hope to find very performant combinations of the two.  See [notebooks](./notebooks) folder for tutorials on how to use the library.

## Installation

You need to install this library locally before running any of the notebooks this repository or the [main demonstration](https://github.com/OpenMined/sonar):

```sh
# Get dependencies ready
pip install -r requirements.txt
# install the lib locally
python setup.py install
```

### For Anaconda Users:

```
bash install_for_anaconda_users.sh
```

### For Docker Users

Install Docker from https://www.docker.com/
For macOS users with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) installed, use `brew cask install docker`

Then, run:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/OpenMined/PySyft.git
cd PySyft/notebooks/
docker run --rm -it -v $PWD:/notebooks -w /notebooks -p 8888:8888 openmined/pysyft jupyter notebook --ip=0.0.0.0 --allow-root
```
