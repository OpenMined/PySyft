> Homomorphically Encrypted Deep Learning Library

The goal of this library is to give the user the ability to efficiently train Deep Learning models in a homomorphically encrypted state, without needing to be an expert in either. Furthermore, by understanding the characteristics of both Deep Learning and Homomorphic Encryption, we hope to find a very performant combinations of the two.  See the [notebooks](./notebooks) folder for tutorials on how to use the library. Also, check the [main demonstration](https://github.com/OpenMined/sonar) from the Sonar project.

## Setup with Docker

The fastest way to get started is to use the pre-assembled Docker image (works on all major operating systems). Alternatively, one can manually set up all the dependencies and develop locally.

### Get Docker
Install Docker following the instructions on the [website](https://www.docker.com/).

For macOS users with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) installed, use:
```sh
brew cask install docker
open -a docker
```

You can ensure that Docker is properly installed and running by checking: `docker --version`.

### Run PySyft in a container
First, clone this repository and navigate into its folder:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/OpenMined/PySyft.git
cd PySyft
```

Now, start a container based on [openmined/pysyft](https://hub.docker.com/r/openmined/pysyft/):
```sh
make docker-build
make docker-run
```
In this container, you'll be able to open a Python shell, import the library and develop with it.

However, if you want to use Jupyter, try the provided notebooks, and make changes to the source,
you should create your personal development image:
```sh
make docker-build-dev
make docker-run image=openmined/pysyft-dev:local
```

Inside the container you can run any make targets such as `test` or `notebook`.

## Local setup

### Prerequisites

- Make sure Python 3.5+ in installed on your machine by checking `python3 --version`
- Install the base libraries listed [here](https://github.com/OpenMined/PySonar/blob/master/README.md#base-libraries)
- Set up a virtual environment for the Python libraries (optional, recommended)
- Install [Capsule](https://github.com/OpenMined/Capsule) dependency if you are going to develop and run tests.

### Python Requirements

The Python dependencies are listed in [`requirements.txt`](./requirements.txt) and can be installed through
```sh
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Additional test and development dependencies such as scikit-learn and Jupyter are
listed in [`dev-requirements.txt`](./dev-requirements.txt):
```sh
pip3 install -r dev-requirements.txt
```

#### PySyft installation
If you simply want to to _use_ PySyft, it is enough to install the library with:
```sh
python3 setup.py install
```

Instead, if you want to make changes to the source, fix bugs, add features etc.,
it's recommended to install PySyft in development mode:
```sh
python3 setup.py develop
```

#### Anaconda

```sh
bash install_for_anaconda_users.sh
```

__Note:__ if after running the above script, you have troubles importing Syft in your Jupyter notebook, try this:

```sh
# activate your env, if you haven't already
source activate openmined  
pip install ipykernel
python -m ipykernel install --user --name=openmined
```

#### Windows

```sh
conda install -c conda-forge gmpy2
pip install -r requirements.txt
python setup.py install
```

## Notebooks
The make target `notebook` will launch a Jupyter server (either locally or in the container).
```sh
make notebook
```

## Testing
The make target `test` will run all tests with `pytest` and `flake8` (either locally or in the container).
```sh
make test
```
