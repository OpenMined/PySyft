Creating a Network
===============================================


What is a Network Node?
-----------------------------------------------------

A Network Node is a node that connects different domains to a broader base of data scientists (also known as a network's members). It is a server which exists outside of any data owner's institution, providing services to the network of data owners and data scientists.

In short, a Network node provides a secure interface between its cohorts or Domains and its members or Data Scientists.

Let us give an example: assume you are in a hospital and the hospital has different cancer related datasets hosted on their domain. The hospital's data owners now want to increase the visibility and searchability of these datasets, so that more and more researches and doctors can utilise these datasets and advance our understanding and diagnosis of cancer.

However, due to privacy concerns, they do not want to provide access to random actors, such as sharing the URL of the domain with everyone. In order to tackle this privacy issue and make the dataset still accessible, the domain owner can join a Network Node (for example the one hosted by WHO) hence opening the accessibility of their datasets to a much larger audience in a private and secure manner.


Why do you need a new Network Node?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Before requesting a Network Creation, please read the following carefully:


Ask yourself the below questions based on your use-case:

* Do you want to enable data owners to host their dataset without sharing their domain URL?
* Do you have similar-purpose serving datasets?
* Do you want to improve the visibility and searchability of the datasets hosted on your Network Node?
* Do you want data scientists and researchers connect to your Network Node to perform remote Data Science?


If you answer the above questions with a **Yes**, then you might be looking to create your own network. Fill up the form below and we will get back to you with further instructions on how to proceed.
