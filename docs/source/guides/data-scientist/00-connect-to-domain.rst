Data Scientists are end users who desire to perform ``computations`` or ``answer`` a specific question 
using one or more data owners' datasets. The very first thing Data Scientists have to do is ``login`` 
and ``connect`` to the Domain Server of their organization's private data server. Today's tutorial shows 
how Data Scientists can connect to an organization's private data servers using ``PyGrids UI``.  

For connecting to a Domain Server, we will use PyGrid's UI interface with the login credentials 
assigned by the Domain Owners. By default, the Data Scientists have the lowest level of ``permission`` 
to access the data (which means data is highly private) and will be assigned a Privacy Budget of ``0``.

   can :doc:`create a user account <02-create-account-configure-pb>` on their Domain Servers.
