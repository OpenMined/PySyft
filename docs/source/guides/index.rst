How-to Guides
======================
``Syft`` is OpenMined's ``open source`` stack that provides ``secure`` and ``private`` Data Science 
in Python. Syft decouples ``private data`` from model training, using techniques 
like `Federated Learning <https://ai.googleblog.com/2017/04/federated-learning-collaborative.html>`_, 
`Differential Privacy <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_privacy>`_, and 
`Encrypted Computation <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homomorphic_encryption>`_. 
This is done with a ``numpy``-like interface and integration with ``Deep Learning`` 
frameworks, so that you as a ``Data Scientist`` can maintain your current workflow 
while using these new ``privacy-enhancing techniques``.

Once you have the installation completed, the best place to start is by ``identifying`` your role. 

A. Getting Started with Data Owner 👨🏻‍💼
--------------------------------------
Data Owners provide ``datasets`` which they would like to make available for ``study`` by 
an ``outside party`` they may or may not ``fully trust`` has good intentions.

B. Getting Started with Data Scientist 👩🏽‍🔬
------------------------------------------
Data Scientist's are end ``users`` who desire to perform ``computations`` or ``answer`` a 
specific ``question`` using one or more data owners' ``datasets``.
