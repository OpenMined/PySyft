How-to Guides
======================

The PySyft guides are written in ``Jupyter Labs`` in a hosted network environment. Follow the instructions to get started. 

    **Note:** This section is incomplete and currently in progress.

**Important:** To run all the tutorials interactively in Jupyter Lab on your own machine type:

:: 
   
   pip install -U hagrid
   hagrid quickstart

Once you have the installation completed, the best place to start is by ``identifying`` your role.
