Welcome to the domain deployment installation tutorials!
This section of our documentation is designed to be the
simplest way to get you started deploying your data to a domain node
on an OSX, Linux, or Windows machine and interacting with it
as a data scientist using PySyft.

.. note:: 
  If you're looking
  for cloud deployment, or more advanced tutorials such as
  ansible, vagrant, kubernetes, or virtualbox deployment, please see the
  `advanced deployment documentation <https://openmined.github.io/PySyft/deployment/index.html#>`__.

The purpose of these tutorials is to help you install everything
you need to run a Domain node from your personal machine (such
as if you're running through OpenMined
`courses <https://courses.openmined.org/#>`__
or
`tutorials <https://github.com/OpenMined/PySyft/tree/dev/notebooks#>`__).
To that end, we will also be installing everything you might need to run Jupyter
notebooks with PySyft installed, such as if you're pretending to be
both Data Owner and Data Scientist as a part of a tutorial or course.


**We will be setting up the following dependencies before PySyft and PyGrid:**

* Python >=3.9
* pip
* Conda 
* Jupyter notebook
* Docker

If you already have all of them, jump `here! <https://openmined.github.io/PySyft/install_tutorials/have_prerequisites.html#>`__


What OS are you on?
--------------------------------

If you are unsure about the above, don't worry, we got you covered.
The first step of your journey is to figure out which operating system you are running
and choose the right tutorial for installation. 
There are 3 types of operating systems for you to choose from:

#. `OSX <https://openmined.github.io/PySyft/install_tutorials/osx_11_5_1.html#>`__

#. `Linux <https://openmined.github.io/PySyft/install_tutorials/linux.html##>`__

#. `Windows <https://openmined.github.io/PySyft/install_tutorials/windows.html>`__

Best of luck on your journey!
