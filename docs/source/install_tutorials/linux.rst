Installation on Linux

This documentation is to help you install and be able to deploy a Domain Node on Ubuntu Linux, with a version of ``20.04.03`` or newer, in the simplest way possible.

.. note::
  Do you use a different distribution other than Ubuntu? Don't worry, just replace the ``apt`` & ``apt-get`` with your package manager.

.. seealso::

   For more advanced tutorials, such as cloud deployment, ansible, vagrant, kubernetes, or virtualbox deployment, please check
   `advanced deployment documentation <https://openmined.github.io/PySyft/deployment/index.html#>`__.



1. **Launching a Terminal Instance**

We will use the Linux Terminal to install all the prerequisites and launch the domain. A quick way to launch the terminal is by pressing ``Ctrl+Alt+T``. Let's go!

2. **Installing Python 3.9**

We'll be working with Python 3.9 or newer. To check if you have it installed, you may run:

.. code-block:: bash

   python3 --version

Your output should looks something like ``Python 3.x.y`` where x>=9.

If you don't have the correct version of Python, installing it is as easy as running the following:

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install python3.9
   python3 --version

3. **Installing and using Pip**

`Pip <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/>`__ is the most widely used package installer for Python and will help us to install the required dependencies MUCH easier.
You can install it by running the following:

.. code-block:: bash

   python -m ensurepip --upgrade

If you already have it installed, you can check to make sure it's the latest version by running:

.. code-block:: bash

   python -m pip install --upgrade pip

Your output should looks something like ``Requirement already satisfied: pip in <package-dir>``.

4. **Conda and setting up a virtual environment**

Conda is a package manager that helps you to easily install a lot of data science and machine learning packages, but also to create a separated environment when a certain set of dependencies need to be installed.
To install Conda, you can:

a. Download the `Anaconda installer <https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#Downloads>`__.

b. Run the following code, modifying it depending on where you downloaded the installer (e.g. `~/Downloads/`):

    .. code-block:: bash

        bash ~/Downloads/Anaconda3-2020.02-Linux-x86_64.sh

    .. note::

        Please note that the naming might be different given it could be a newer version of Anaconda.

c. Create a new env specifying the Python version (we recommend Python 3.8/3.9) in the terminal:

    .. code-block:: bash

        conda create -n syft_env python=3.9
        conda activate syft_env


d. To exit, you can run:

    .. code-block:: bash

        conda deactivate

5. **Install Jupyter Notebook**

A very convenient way to interact with a deployed node is via Python, using a Jupyter Notebook. You can install it by running:

.. code-block:: bash

  pip install jupyter-notebook

If you encounter issues, you can also install it using Conda:

.. code-block:: bash

  conda install -c conda-forge notebook

To launch the Jupyter Notebook, you can run the following in your terminal:

.. code-block:: bash

  jupyter notebook

6. **Installing and configuring Docker**

`Docker <https://docs.docker.com/get-started/overview/>`__ is a framework which allows us to separate the infrastructure needed to run PySyft in an isolated environment called a ``container`` which you can use off the shelf, without many concerns.
If it sounds complicated, please don't worry, we will walk you through all steps, and you'll be done in no time!
Additionally, we will also use `Docker Composite V2 <https://docs.docker.com/compose/>`_, which allows us to run multi-container applications.


a. Install **Docker**:

    .. code-block:: bash

       sudo apt-get upgrade docker & docker run hello-world

b. Install **Docker Composite V2** as described `here <https://docs.docker.com/compose/cli-command/#installing-compose-v2>`__.

c. Run the below command to verify the install:

    .. code-block:: bash

       docker compose version
    
    You should see somthing like ``Docker Compose version 2.x.y`` in the output when runnning the above command.

d. If you see something else, go through the `instructions here <https://www.rockyourcode.com/how-to-install-docker-compose-v2-on-linux-2021/>`__ or if you are using Linux, you can try to do:

    .. code-block:: bash

       mkdir -p ~/.docker/cli-plugins
       curl -sSL https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/v2.2.3/docker-compose-linux-x86_64 -o ~/.docker/cli-plugins/docker-compose
       chmod +x ~/.docker/cli-plugins/docker-compose

e. Also, make sure you can run without sudo:

    .. code-block:: bash

       echo $USER //(should return your username)
       sudo usermod -aG docker $USER

6. **Install PySyft and Hagrid**

The hardest part is done! To install the OpenMined stack that you need in order to deploy a node, please run:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install syft hagrid


PySyft is a library which contains the tools to run privacy preserving machine learning.
Hagrid is a commandline tool that speeds up the deployment of PyGrid, the provider of a peer-to-peer network of
data owners and data scientists who can collectively train AI model using Syft.

7. **Launch the Domain Node**

Congrats for making it this far! You only have one final step remaining, before you unleash the power of Hagrid!
The final step is to launch a domain node, which is as easy as:

.. code-block:: bash

   hagrid launch <name_of_domain>

To stop the running domain, run:

.. code-block:: bash

   hagrid land <name_of_domain>

But before stopping it, you can go to ``localhost:8081`` in your `browser <localhost:8081>`_ to actually interact with the PyGrid Admin UI, where you can manage as a Data Owner your datasets, as well as incoming requests from data scientist.
You can log in using the following credentials:

.. code-block:: python

   info@openmined.org

   changethis

Now you're all set up to fully start using PySyft!
