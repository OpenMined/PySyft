    "#### Searching Networks for Domains\n",
    "\n",
    "A Network is a collection of domains. A Network acts a bridge between between its members and subscribers.\n",
    "The members are `Domains` while subscribers are the `end users (e.g. Data Scientist)` who explore and \n",
    "perform analysis on the datasets hosted by the members.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus in short, a Network provides secure a interface between its members and subscribers.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a user/subscriber selects a Network, they can perform the following operations on the Network:\n",
    "- List all the domains in the network. **[P0]**\n",
    "  Following properties of the domain are visible to the user on performing the list operation.\n",
    "    - ID\n",
    "    - Name of the domain\n",
    "    - Tags\n",
    "    - Description\n",
    "    - Organization/Institute **[P1]**\n",
    "- The user is able to select a domain via `ID` or `Name` of the domain. **[P0]**\n",
    "- The user is able to filter through a list of domains via `Name` and `Tags` **[P1]**\n",
    "- A User can select a domain and login into the domain using the credentials (username and password). The URL doesn't need to enter or remember the URL of the domain."
