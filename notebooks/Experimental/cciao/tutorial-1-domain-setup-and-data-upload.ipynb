    "**PySyft** is the main library containing a set of data serialization and remote code execution APIs which mimic existing popular Data Science tools while working interchangeably with existing popular data types. One of the ways this works is by providing a special Proxy object in Python which acts like a Network Pointer to a remote object on a Domain Server. These Pointers look, act and feel just like real objects, but cannot be copied or viewed without special permissions. Therefore, PySyft enables execution of Data Science operations without sending in raw code or copying data from the data owners' server. The python package for PySyft is called `syft`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**PyGrid** is the server component of PySyft. PyGrid nodes are referred by their type, e.g. domain server or network server. These are cross-platform servers running where the data lives (a.k.a. at the data owners' premise).\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, **HAGrid** is a very handy `cli` tool which takes care of all the heavy-lifting in the background and makes deploying a Domain or Network server very easy. It also comes with an interactive UI. The python package for HAGrid is called `hagrid`."

These commands can be Copy + Pasted into a cell and ran here, or if you know how to use the terminal on your server, you can  simply remove the ! at the start of the command and paste it there instead.

    "### (Optional) \n",
    "### Installation on Linux\n",
    "\n",
    "This section is to help you install and be able to deploy a Domain Node on Ubuntu Linux, with a version of `20.04.03` or newer, in the simplest way possible. If you have a different distribution other than Ubuntu, just replace the `apt` & `apt-get` with your package manager.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Launching a Terminal Instance\n",
    "We will use the Linux Terminal to install all the prerequisites and launch the domain. A quick way to launch the terminal is by pressing Ctrl+Alt+T.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Installing Python 3.9 or newer\n",
    "We’ll be working with Python 3.9 or newer. To check if you have it installed, you may run:\n",
    "\n",
    "`python3 --version`\n",
    "\n",
    "Your output should looks something like Python `3.x.y` where x>=9.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you don’t have the correct version of Python, installing it is as easy as running the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "sudo apt update\n",
    "sudo apt install python3.9\n",
    "python3 --version\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Installing and using Pip\n",
    "\n",
    "Pip is the most widely used package installer for Python and will help us to install the required dependencies MUCH easier. You can install it by running the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "`python -m ensurepip --upgrade`\n",
    "\n",
    "If you already have it installed, you can check to make sure it’s the latest version by running:\n",
    "\n",
    "`python -m pip install --upgrade pip`\n",
    "\n",
    "Your output should looks something like `Requirement already satisfied: pip in <package-dir>.`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Conda and setting up a virtual environment\n",
    "\n",
    "Conda is a package manager that helps you to easily install a lot of data science and machine learning packages, but also to create a separated environment when a certain set of dependencies need to be installed. To install Conda, you can:\n",
    "\n",
    "a. Download the [Anaconda installer](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#Downloads).\n",
    "\n",
    "b. Run the following code, modifying it depending on where you downloaded the installer (e.g. `~/Downloads/`):\n",
    "\n",
    "`bash ~/Downloads/Anaconda3-2020.02-Linux-x86_64.sh`\n",
    "\n",
    "The naming might be different given it could be a newer version of Anaconda.\n",
    "\n",
    "c. Create a new env specifying the Python version (we recommend Python 3.8/3.9) in the terminal:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda create -n syft_env python=3.9\n",
    "conda activate syft_env\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "d. To exit the env, you can run:\n",
    "\n",
    "`conda deactivate`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Install Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "A very convenient way to interact with a deployed node is via Python, using a Jupyter Notebook. You can install it by running:\n",
    "\n",
    "`pip install jupyterlab`\n",
    "\n",
    "If you encounter issues, you can also install it using Conda:\n",
    "\n",
    "`conda install -c conda-forge notebook`\n",
    "\n",
    "To launch the Jupyter Notebook, you can run the following in your terminal:\n",
    "\n",

    "#### 6. Installing and configuring Docker\n",
    "\n",
    "[Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/overview/) is a framework which allows us to separate the infrastructure needed to run PySyft in an isolated environment called a `container` which you can use off the shelf, without many concerns. If it sounds complicated, please don’t worry, we will walk you through all steps, and you’ll be done in no time! Additionally, we will also use [Docker Composite V2](https://docs.docker.com/compose/), which allows us to run multi-container applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "a. Install Docker by running this command:\n",
    "\n",
    "`sudo apt-get upgrade docker & docker run hello-world`\n",
    "\n",
    "b. Install Docker Composite V2 as described [here](https://docs.docker.com/compose/cli-command/#installing-compose-v2).\n",
    "\n",
    "c. Run the below command to verify the install:\n",
    "\n",
    "`docker compose version`\n",
    "\n",
    "You should see somthing like `Docker Compose version 2.x.y` in the output when runnning the above command.\n",
    "\n",
    "d. If you see something else, go through the [instructions here](https://www.rockyourcode.com/how-to-install-docker-compose-v2-on-linux-2021/) or if you are using Linux, you can try to do:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "mkdir -p ~/.docker/cli-plugins\n",
    "curl -sSL https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/v2.2.3/docker-compose-linux-x86_64 -o ~/.docker/cli-plugins/docker-compose\n",
    "chmod +x ~/.docker/cli-plugins/docker-compose\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "e. Also, make sure you can run without sudo:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "echo $USER //(should return your username)\n",
    "sudo usermod -aG docker $USER\n",
    "```\n",

    "#### 7. Install PySyft and Hagrid\n",
    "Finally, to install the OpenMined stack that you need in order to deploy a node, please run:\n",
