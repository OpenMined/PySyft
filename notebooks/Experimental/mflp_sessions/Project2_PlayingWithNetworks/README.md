# Project 2 - Playing with Networks
* In this session we took a first look at the network api. 
* In the following session we will try to have a domain running for each member of the seesion and create computations across domains
* You can look at either the notebook we wrote togheter or at the prepared references 
* You will need to start domains by install hagrid and running `hagrid launch --tag=latest`
