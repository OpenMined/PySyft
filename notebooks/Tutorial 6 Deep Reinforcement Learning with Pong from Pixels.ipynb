    "This tutorial demonstrates how to implement a deep reinforcement learning (RL) agent from scratch using a policy gradient method that learns to play the [Pong](https://gym.openai.com/envs/Pong-v0/) video game using screen pixels as inputs with NumPy. Your Pong agent will obtain experience on the go using an [artificial neural network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network) as its [policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning).\n",

    "Pong is a 2D game from 1972 where two players use \"rackets\" to play a form of table tennis. Each player moves the racket up and down the screen and tries to hit a ball in their opponent's direction by touching it. The goal is to hit the ball such that it goes past the opponent's racket (they miss their shot). According to the rules, if a player reaches 21 points, they win. In Pong, the RL agent that learns to play against an opponent is displayed on the right.\n",

    "### A note on RL and deep RL\n",
    "\n",
    "In [_RL_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning), your agent learns from trial and error by interacting with an environment using a so-called policy to gain experience. After taking one action, the agent receives information about its reward (which it may or may not get) and the next observation of the environment. It can then proceed to take another action. This happens over a number of episodes and/or until the task is deemed to be complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "The agent's policy works by \"mapping\" the agent's observations to its actions — that is, assigning a presentation of what the agent observes with required actions. The overall goal is usually to optimize the agent's policy such that it maximizes the expected rewards from each observation.\n",
    "\n",
    "For detailed information about RL, there is an [introductory book](https://web.archive.org/web/20050806080008/http://www.cs.ualberta.ca/~sutton/book/the-book.html) by Richard Sutton and Andrew Barton.\n",
    "\n",
    "Check out the Appendix at the end of the tutorial for more information.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deep RL glossary\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a concise glossary of deep RL terms you may find useful for the remaining part of the tutorial:\n",
    "\n",
    "- In a finite-horizon world, such as a game of Pong, the learning agent can explore (and exploit) the _environment_ over an _episode_. It usually takes many episodes for the agent to learn.\n",
    "- The agent interacts with the _environment_ using _actions_.\n",
    "- After taking an action, the agent receives some feedback through a _reward_ (if there is one), depending on which action it takes and the _state_ it is in. The state contains information about the environment.\n",
    "- The agent's _observation_ is a partial observation of the state — this is the term this tutorial prefers (instead of _state_).\n",
    "- The agent can choose an action based on cumulative _rewards_ (also known as the _value function_) and the _policy_. The _cumulative reward function_ estimates the quality of the observations the agent visits using its _policy_.\n",
    "- The _policy_ (defined by a neural network) outputs action choices (as (log) probabilities) that should maximize the cumulative rewards from the state the agent is in.\n",
    "- The _expected return from an observation_, conditional to the action, is called the _action-value_ function. To provide more weight to shorter-term rewards versus the longer-term ones, you usually use a _discount factor_ (often a floating point number between 0.9 and 0.99).\n",
    "- The sequence of actions and states (observations) during each policy \"run\" by the agent is sometimes referred to as a _trajectory_ — such a sequence yields _rewards_.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will train your Pong agent through an \"on-policy\" method using policy gradients — it's an algorithm belonging to a family of _policy-based_ methods. Policy gradient methods typically update the parameters of the policy with respect to the long-term cumulative reward using [_gradient descent_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_descent) that is widely used in machine learning. And, since the goal is to maximize the function (the rewards), not minimize it, the process is also called _gradient ascent_. In other words, you use a policy for the agent to take actions and the objective is to maximize the rewards, which you do by computing the gradients and use them to update the parameters in the policy (neural) network.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Set up Pong\n",
    "\n",
    "**1.** First, you should install OpenAI Gym (using `pip install gym[atari]` - this package is currently not available on conda), and import NumPy, Gym and the necessary modules:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "import gym\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Gym can monitor and save the output using the `Monitor` wrapper:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from gym import wrappers\n",
    "from gym.wrappers import Monitor\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**2.** Instantiate a Gym environment for the game of Pong:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "env = gym.make(\"Pong-v0\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**3.** Let's review which actions are available in the `Pong-v0` environment:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(env.action_space)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(env.get_action_meanings())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 6 actions. However, `LEFTFIRE` is actually `LEFT`, `RIGHTFIRE` — `RIGHT`, and `NOOP` — `FIRE`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For simplicity, your policy network will have one output — a (log) probability for \"moving up\" (indexed at `2` or `RIGHT`). The other available action will be indexed at 3 (\"move down\" or `LEFT`).\n",
    "\n",
    "**4.** Gym can save videos of the agent's learning in an MP4 format — wrap `Monitor()` around the environment by running the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "env = Monitor(env, \"./video\", force=True)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "While you can perform all kinds of RL experiments in a Jupyter notebook, rendering images or videos of a Gym environment to visualize how your agent plays the game of Pong after training can be rather challenging. If you want to set up video playback in a notebook, you can find the details in the Appendix at the end of this tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Preprocess frames (the observation)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section you will set up a function to preprocess the input data (game observation) to make it digestible for the neural network, which can only work with inputs that are in a form of tensors (multidimensional arrays) of floating-point type.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your agent will use the frames from the Pong game — pixels from screen frames — as input-observations for the policy network. The game observation tells the agent about where the ball is before it is fed (with a forward pass) into the neural network (the policy). This is similar to DeepMind's [DQN](https://deepmind.com/research/open-source/dqn) method (which is further discussed in the Appendix).\n",
    "\n",
    "Pong screen frames are 210x160 pixels over 3 color dimensions (red, green and blue). The arrays are encoded with `uint8` (or 8-bit integers), and these observations are stored on a Gym Box instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1.** Check the Pong's observations:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(env.observation_space)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In Gym, the agent's actions and observations can be part of the `Box` (n-dimensional) or `Discrete` (fixed-range integers) classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2.** You can view a random observation — one frame — by:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1) Setting the random `seed` before initialization (optional).\n",
    "\n",
    "    2) Calling  Gym's `reset()` to reset the environment, which returns an initial observation.\n",
    "\n",
    "    3) Using Matplotlib to display the `render`ed observation.\n",
    "\n",
    "(You can refer to the OpenAI Gym core [API](https://github.com/openai/gym/blob/master/gym/core.py) for more information about Gym's core classes and methods.)\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
    "\n",
    "env.seed(42)\n",
    "env.reset()\n",
    "random_frame = env.render(mode=\"rgb_array\")\n",
    "print(random_frame.shape)\n",
    "plt.imshow(random_frame)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To feed the observations into the policy (neural) network, you need to convert them into 1D grayscale vectors with 6,400 (80x80x1) floating point arrays. (During training, you will use NumPy's [`np.ravel()`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.ravel.html) function to flatten these arrays.)\n",
    "\n",
    "**3.** Set up a helper function for frame (observation) preprocessing:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def frame_preprocessing(observation_frame):\n",
    "    # Crop the frame.\n",
    "    observation_frame = observation_frame[35:195]\n",
    "    # Downsample the frame by a factor of 2.\n",
    "    observation_frame = observation_frame[::2, ::2, 0]\n",
    "    # Remove the background and apply other enhancements.\n",
    "    observation_frame[observation_frame == 144] = 0  # Erase the background (type 1).\n",
    "    observation_frame[observation_frame == 109] = 0  # Erase the background (type 2).\n",
    "    observation_frame[observation_frame != 0] = 1  # Set the items (rackets, ball) to 1.\n",
    "    # Return the preprocessed frame as a 1D floating-point array.\n",
    "    return observation_frame.astype(float)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**4.** Preprocess the random frame from earlier to test the function — the input for the policy network is an 80x80 1D image:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "preprocessed_random_frame = frame_preprocessing(random_frame)\n",
    "plt.imshow(preprocessed_random_frame, cmap=\"gray\")\n",
    "print(preprocessed_random_frame.shape)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Create the policy (the neural network) and the forward pass\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, you will define the policy as a simple feedforward network that uses a game observation as an input and outputs an action log probability:\n",
    "\n",
    "- For the _input_, it will use the Pong video game frames — the preprocessed 1D vectors with 6,400 (80x80) floating point arrays.\n",
    "- The _hidden layer_ will compute the weighted sum of inputs using NumPy's dot product function [`np.dot()`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.dot.html) for the arrays and then apply a _non-linear activation function_, such as [ReLU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectifier_(neural_networks)).\n",
    "- Then, the _output layer_ will perform the matrix-multiplication again of  weight parameters and the hidden layer's output (with [`np.dot()`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.dot.html)), and send that information through a [softmax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softmax_function) _activation function_.\n",
    "- In the end, the policy network will output one action log probability (given that observation) for the agent — the probability for Pong action indexed in the environment at 2 (\"moving the racket up\").\n",
    "\n",
    "**1.** Let's instantiate certain parameters for the input, hidden, and output layers, and start setting up the network model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Start by creating a random number generator instance for the experiment\n",
    "(seeded for reproducibility):\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "rng = np.random.default_rng(seed=12288743)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Set the input (observation) dimensionality - your preprocessed screen frames:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "D = 80 * 80\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Set the number of hidden layer neurons.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "H = 200\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Instantiate your policy (neural) network model as an empty dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "model = {}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In a neural network, _weights_ are important adjustable parameters that the network fine-tunes by forward and backward propagating the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2.** Using a technique called [Xavier initialization](https://www.deeplearning.ai/ai-notes/initialization/#IV), set up the network model's initial weights with NumPy's [`Generator.standard_normal()`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/random/generated/numpy.random.Generator.standard_normal.html) that returns random numbers over a standard Normal distribution, as well as [`np.sqrt()`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.sqrt.html?highlight=numpy.sqrt#numpy.sqrt):\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "model[\"W1\"] = rng.standard_normal(size=(H, D)) / np.sqrt(D)\n",
    "model[\"W2\"] = rng.standard_normal(size=H) / np.sqrt(H)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**3.** Your policy network starts by randomly initializing the weights and feeds the input data (frames) forward from the input layer through a hidden layer to the output layers. This process is called the _forward pass_ or _forward propagation_, and is outlined in the function `policy_forward()`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def policy_forward(x, model):\n",
    "    # Matrix-multiply the weights by the input in the one and only hidden layer.\n",
    "    h = np.dot(model[\"W1\"], x)\n",
    "    # Apply non-linearity with ReLU.\n",
    "    h[h < 0] = 0\n",
    "    # Calculate the \"dot\" product in the outer layer.\n",
    "    # The input for the sigmoid function is called logit.\n",
    "    logit = np.dot(model[\"W2\"], h)\n",
    "    # Apply the sigmoid function (non-linear activation).\n",
    "    p = sigmoid(logit)\n",
    "    # Return a log probability for the action 2 (\"move up\")\n",
    "    # and the hidden \"state\" that you need for backpropagation.\n",
    "    return p, h\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that there are two _activation functions_ for determining non-linear relationships between inputs and outputs. These [non-linear functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activation_function) are applied to the output of the layers:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Rectified linear unit (ReLU)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectifier_(neural_networks)): defined as `h[h<0] = 0` above. It returns 0 for negative inputs and the same value if it's positive.\n",
    "- [Sigmoid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmoid_function): defined below as `sigmoid()`. It \"wraps\" the last layer's output and returns an action log probability in the (0, 1) range.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4.** Define the sigmoid function separately with NumPy's [`np.exp()`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.exp.html?highlight=numpy.exp#numpy.exp) for computing exponentials:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def sigmoid(x):\n",
    "    return 1.0 / (1.0 + np.exp(-x))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Set up the update step (backpropagation)\n",
    "\n",
    "During learning in your deep RL algorithm, you use the action log probabilities (given an observation) and the discounted returns (for example, +1 or -1 in Pong) and perform the _backward pass_ or _backpropagation_ to update the parameters — the policy network's weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1.** Let's define the backward pass function (`policy_backward()`) with the help of NumPy's modules for array multiplication — [`np.dot()`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.dot.html?highlight=numpy.dot#numpy.dot) (matrix multiplication), [`np.outer()`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.outer.html) (outer product computation), and [`np.ravel()`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.ravel.html) (to flatten arrays into 1D arrays):\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def policy_backward(eph, epdlogp, model):\n",
    "    dW2 = np.dot(eph.T, epdlogp).ravel()\n",
    "    dh = np.outer(epdlogp, model[\"W2\"])\n",
    "    dh[eph <= 0] = 0\n",
    "    dW1 = np.dot(dh.T, epx)\n",
    "    # Return new \"optimized\" weights for the policy network.\n",
    "    return {\"W1\": dW1, \"W2\": dW2}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the intermediate hidden \"states\" of the network (`eph`) and the gradients of action log probabilities (`epdlogp`) for an episode, the `policy_backward` function propagates the gradients back through the policy network and update the weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2.** When applying backpropagation during agent training, you will need to save several variables for each episode. Let's instantiate empty lists to store them:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# All preprocessed observations for the episode.\n",
    "xs = []\n",
    "# All hidden \"states\" (from the network) for the episode.\n",
    "hs = []\n",
    "# All gradients of probability actions\n",
    "# (with respect to observations) for the episode.\n",
    "dlogps = []\n",
    "# All rewards for the episode.\n",
    "drs = []\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You will reset these variables manually at the end of each episode during training after they are \"full\" and reshape with NumPy's [`np.vstack()`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.vstack.html). This is demonstrated in the training stage towards the end of the tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3.** Next, to perform a gradient ascent when optimizing the agent's policy, it is common to use deep learning _optimizers_ (you're performing optimization with gradients). In this example, you'll use [RMSProp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_gradient_descent#RMSProp) — an adaptive optimization [method](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~tijmen/csc321/slides/lecture_slides_lec6.pdf). Let's set a discounting factor — a decay rate — for the optimizer:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "decay_rate = 0.99\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**4.** You will also need to store the gradients (with the help of NumPy's [`np.zeros_like()`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.zeros_like.html)) for the optimization step during training:\n",
    "\n",
    "- First, save the update buffers that add up gradients over a batch:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "grad_buffer = {k: np.zeros_like(v) for k, v in model.items()}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- Second, store the RMSProp memory for the optimizer for gradient ascent:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "rmsprop_cache = {k: np.zeros_like(v) for k, v in model.items()}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Define the discounted rewards (expected return) function\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, you will set up a function for computing discounted rewards (`discount_rewards()`) — the expected return from an observation — that uses a 1D array of rewards as inputs (with the help of NumPy's [`np.zeros_like()`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.zeros_like.html)) function.\n",
    "\n",
    "To provide more weight to shorter-term rewards over longer-term ones, you will use a _discount factor_ (gamma) that is often a floating-point number between 0.9 and 0.99.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "gamma = 0.99\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "def discount_rewards(r, gamma):\n",

    "- If you have previously run an experiment and want to repeat it, your `Monitor` instance may still be running, which may throw an error the next time you try to traini the agent. Therefore, you should first shut down `Monitor` by calling `env.close()` by uncommenting and running the cell below:\n",

    "- In Pong, if a player doesn't hit the ball back, they receive a negative reward (-1) and the other player gets a +1 reward. The rewards that the agent receives by playing Pong have a significant variance. Therefore, it's best practice to normalize them with the same mean (using [`np.mean()`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.mean.html)) and standard deviation (using NumPy's [`np.std()`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.std.html?highlight=std)).\n",
    "\n",
    "- When using only NumPy, the deep RL training process, including backpropagation, spans several lines of code that may appear quite long. One of the main reasons for this is you're not using a deep learning framework with an automatic differentiation library that usually simplifies such experiments. This tutorial shows how to perform everything from scratch but you can also use one of many Python-based frameworks with \"autodiff\" and \"autograd\", which you will learn about at the end of the tutorial.\n",

    "You may notice that training an RL agent takes a long time if you increase the number of episodes from 100 to 500 or 1,000+, depending on the hardware — CPUs and GPUs — you are using for this task.\n",
    "\n",
    "Policy gradient methods can learn a task if you give them a lot of time, and optimization in RL is a challenging problem. Training agents to learn to play Pong or any other task can be sample-inefficient and require a lot of episodes. You may also notice in your training output that even after hundreds of episodes, the rewards may have high variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, like in many deep learning-based algorithms, you should take into account a large amount of parameters that your policy has to learn. In Pong, this number adds up to 1 million or more with 200 nodes in the hidden layer of the network and the input dimension being of size 6,400 (80x80). Therefore, adding more CPUs and GPUs to assist with training can always be an option.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use a much more advanced policy gradient-based algorithm that can help speed up training, improve the sensitivity to parameters, and resolve other issues. For example, there are \"self-play\" methods, such as [Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.06347) developed by [John Schulman](http://joschu.net) et al in 2017, which were [used](https://openai.com/blog/openai-five/#rapid) to train the [OpenAI Five](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.06680.pdf) agent over 10 months to play Dota 2 at a competitive level.

    "- _Deep RL_ combines RL with [deep learning](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/absps/NatureDeepReview.pdf). The field had its first major success in more complex environments, such as video games, in 2013 — a year after the [AlexNet](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/4824-imagenet-classification-with-deep-convolutional-neural-networks.pdf) breakthrough in computer vision. Volodymyr Mnih and colleagues at DeepMind published a research paper called [Playing Atari with deep reinforcement learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.5602) (and [updated](https://web.stanford.edu/class/psych209/Readings/MnihEtAlHassibis15NatureControlDeepRL.pdf) in 2015) that showed that they were able to train an agent that could play several classic games from the Arcade Learning Environment at a human-level. Their RL algorithm — called a deep Q-network (DQN) — used [convolutional layers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network) in a neural network that approximated [Q learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q-learning) and used [experience replay](https://web.stanford.edu/class/psych209/Readings/MnihEtAlHassibis15NatureControlDeepRL.pdf).\n",

They were influenced by a number of previous works, including statistical gradient-following algorithms, such as [REINFORCE](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Simple-statistical-gradient-following-algorithms-Williams/4c915c1eecb217c123a36dc6d3ce52d12c742614) (Ronald Williams, 1992), as well as [backpropagation](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/absps/naturebp.pdf) (Geoffrey Hinton, 1986), which helps deep learning algorithms learn.

Then, you can run your Gym experiment through `python your-code.py` in your terminal. To enable rendering, you can use the command-line interface by following the [official OpenAI Gym documentation](https://github.com/openai/gym#rendering-on-a-server) (make sure you have Gym and Xvfb installed, as described in the guide)."
