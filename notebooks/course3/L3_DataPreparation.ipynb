    "\n",
    "Data Acquisition focuses on generating and capturing data into a system. Broadly speaking, it's made up of two phases: <b> data harvesting</b>, and <b>data ingestion</b>. The former, we'll cover in this lesson, and the latter, we'll show you over the next two lessons.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1.1 Data Harvesting\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course, we're using generated or pre-gathered datasets, but in the real world data comes in many forms and contexts - we'll cover some in the next section. How do you get your own data? The phrase \"data harvesting\" might sound like a callback to movies about robotic uprisings, but the wording is truly operative! In this process we are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Identifying sources of potentially fruitful data\n",
    "2. Building a process to gather it\n",
    "3. Running that process\n",
    "4. Carefully checking the outcomes\n",
    "5. Putting the data in a shareable format\n",
    "6. Delivering the data to intended recipient\n",
    "\n",
    "Thinking of the data gathering process as akin to a farmer's harvest is actually a useful framing of the relevant tasks and problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "- There may be better sources of data\n",
    "- The data may be flawed or need care and pruning\n",
    "- The data and format should align with the intended recipient's needs\n",
    "- etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key problem here, however, is `Is this the data that we need?` No amount of harvesting improvements or fancy formatting can solve for data that doesn't suit the problem you're trying to solve in some key aspect. To help with this, let's consider some useful ways to think about data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1.2 The 4 V's of Data \n",
    "\n",
    "When it comes to thinking about data, there are usually four major things to think about, commonly referred to in the industry as the 4 V's of data. They are:\n",
    "\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "<li><b> Volume </b> refers to the quantity or amount of data in question.\n",
    "An example of low volume: if you're collecting sensitive data about people with a rare condition.\n",
    "An example of high volume would be most social media applications that you've heard of. For instance, Facebook has more users than China has people. And each of those people are making posts, uploading pictures, liking content- that adds up to trillions of photos that they can use for data science and machine learning. </li>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<li><b> Velocity </b> refers to the rate at which new data is being gathered or collected.\n",
    "For instance, if you're a company, performance reviews might only come once a quarter.\n",
    "But if you're YouTube, then in one day, you have over 700,000 hours of new videos added. For context, that's longer than the average human lifespan. So if a new person was born tomorrow, and they spent every moment of their life just trying to watch the YouTube videos uploaded on the day they were born, on average they wouldn't be able to get through them all. </li>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<li><b> Variety </b> refers to the diversity of the data that's being collected. For example, think of the difference between a dataset consisting of polls, and a dataset consisting of emails. No two emails are necessarily quite the same. They could contain quite literally, anything- text about anything, pictures of anything, attachments of any kind, etc. </li>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<li><b> Value </b> refers to the idea that not all kinds of data are of equal value. Let's say you're collecting medical images, and some of the images were corrupted during the acquisition process, and were blurry and grainy as a result. That data isn't quite as valuable as a pristine scan.</li>"

    "## 3.3. Data Annotation\n",
    "\n",
    "In many cases, it's not just data that we need. It's annotated, or in other words, <b> labelled </b> data. For example, let's say I wanted to train a Neural Network to classify images of lungs based on whether or not the person had a healthy lung. Having the images alone wouldn't be enough; I'd also need a way of knowing which image corresponded to a healthy lung, and which ones don't.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are other kinds of annotation as well, such as semantic segmentation, bounding boxes, landmark and keypoint, and others. We won't go into too much detail about these, but feel free to check out some of the external resources and references at the bottom of this notebook!\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.3.1 Common annotation types\n",
    "\n",
    "Most often annotations (or *labels*) will take the form of:\n",
    "1. Binary values (true or false)\n",
    "2. Classes (discrete states of being - cat or dog or airplane)\n",
    "3. Continuous values (population counts, dollars and cents, stock market returns)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the data we're using here, we've got a good example of number 3 - population counts. While it is bounded by physical realities, in theory it could be any number between -infinity and +infinity. A machine learning model would need to be able to predict anything in that range.\n",
    "\n",
    "Binary values and classes are considerably more constrained - while some multi-class problems have thousands (or millions!) of classes, they are all discrete and map to defined states.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.3.2 Creating annotations\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of labelling can be very simple, or very complex, depending on the nature of the annotations. For example, the annotations mentioned at the top of this section - healthy or unhealthy lungs - would most likely need to be:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Diagnosed by a radiologist (or several radiologists)\n",
    "2. Recorded (and adjudicated when several radiologists were involved)\n",
    "3. Checked for accuracy\n",
    "\n",
    "More complex annotations (like identifying features of an unhealthy lung) would require bounding boxes or segmentations to be drawn as well, which would need to go through the same process.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, dog vs. cat labels might be applied very quickly, using an automated system or by having humans hand-label them."

If your dataset consisted of ages of various people, the min_val might be 0 years old, and the max_val might be 120 years old (the highest age any human being has ever reached).\n",

    "## 3.6. Linking Data From Multiple Sources\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course, we'll be using the PySyft and PyGrid frameworks to link data from multiple sources (called nodes). This is both really cool and very useful because it lets us perform data science and machine learning on private data on someone else's machine or server, without compromising the privacy of anyone in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In remote data science, because there's a high likelihood that all of our data is not coming from the same source, proper data annotation and cleaning becomes particularly important. This is an important distinction, because:\n",
    "* Different sources may generate data at different rates; some sources stream data whereas others produce data in batches (i.e. in a periodic manner, or at a certain time interval)\n",
    "* Different sources may also have different measuring capabilities, and this might affect the reliability of a dataset. \n",
    "* Different nodes may have different privacy budgets alloted to their respective datasets, which means some datasets may be seen and used much less than others.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b> DID YOU KNOW? </b> A historical example of data sources having different measuring capabilities were the Geiger counters used in Chernobyl. <p>Immediately after the Chernobyl nuclear accident, many people at the time weren't too concerned because measurements from their Geiger counters showed a measurement of 3.6 Roentgen/hour- the equivalent measurement of 10 X-rays. However, it was later discovered that the Geiger counters in use had a maximum detection limit and sensitivity which meant they couldn't detect or measure radiation amounts higher than 3.6 Roentgen per hour. \n",
    "    \n",
    "When new, higher range Geiger counters were used, it was quickly (and shockingly) realized that the radiation being leaked wasn't 3.6 R/h, but around 5.6 R per SECOND. This was the equivalent of 2 Hiroshima nuclear bombs worth of radiation being released per hour.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "Although this is an extreme example, it shows the importance of proper data acquisition and annotating data. Had the authorities known the differences of their data sources at the time, they might have intervened and helped out sooner, and could have saved countless more lives."
