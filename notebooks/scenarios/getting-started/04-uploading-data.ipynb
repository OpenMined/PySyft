The dataset is the largest one on notable deceased people and includes individ- uals from a variety of social groups, including but not limited to 107k females, 90k researchers, and 124 non-binary indi- viduals, spread across more than 300 contemporary or histor- ical regions.\n",

    "- a fixed privacy budget of eps=5 must be preserved by each researcher\n",
