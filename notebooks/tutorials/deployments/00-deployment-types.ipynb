    "# Introduction to PySyft Deployment Options\n",
    "\n",
    "PySyft offers various deployment options catering to different needs and environments. Each deployment option provides a unique set of advantages, allowing users to seamlessly integrate PySyft into their workflows, whether for local development, production deployment, or experimentation in cloud environments. Below, we explore the different deployment options supported by PySyft and provide insights into when each option is most suitable."

    "### 1. Local Python Deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "This deployment option runs PySyft locally within a Python environment. It is lightweight and runs everything in-memory, making it ideal for quick prototyping and testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recommended For:** \n",
    "- Development and testing on resource-constrained systems without Docker support.\n",
    "- Rapid experimentation with PySyft APIs.\n",
    "\n",

    "This deployment option orchestrates the entire PySyft stack on a Kubernetes cluster, enabling scalable and efficient deployment in cloud or on-premises environments. Various Kubernetes configurations are available for deployment flexibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recommended For:**\n",
    "- Production-grade deployments requiring scalability and fault tolerance.\n",
    "- Cloud-native environments where Kubernetes is the preferred orchestration tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "    **[a. Local k3d Cluster Deployment](./03-deploy-k8s-k3d.ipynb)**\n",
    "    - Quick setup for local development and testing using a lightweight Kubernetes cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "    **[b. Azure Deployment](./04-deploy-k8s-azure.ipynb)**\n",
    "    - Deployment on Microsoft Azure cloud infrastructure for scalable and reliable operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "    **[c. GCP Deployment](./05-deploy-k8s-gcp.ipynb)**\n",
    "    - Deployment on Google Cloud Platform for seamless integration with GCP services.\n",
    "\n",
    "    **[d. AWS Deployment](./06-deploy-k8s-aws.ipynb)**\n",

    "\n",
    "This deployment option utilizes Devspace to streamline the development process for PySyft. It provides features such as local image building, port-forwarding, volume mounting, hot-reloading, and debugging to enhance the development experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recommended For:**\n",
    "- Developers contributing to PySyft codebase.\n",

    "### Choosing the Right Deployment Option\n",
    "\n",
    "Selecting the appropriate deployment option depends on factors such as development objectives, resource constraints, scalability requirements, and familiarity with the deployment environment. For quick experimentation and local development, the local Python deployment or single container deployment may suffice. However, for production-grade deployments requiring scalability and reliability, Kubernetes deployment is recommended. Developers actively contributing to PySyft can benefit from the Devspace deployment option for a streamlined development experience."
