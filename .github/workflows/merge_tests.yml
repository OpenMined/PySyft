# Merge Tests
# Once PR tests have passed and we attempt to merge, we run these tests which are more
# comprehensive but very slow. The primary difference is the `pytest -m slow` tests.
# Because the linting and notebook checks have already passed in the PR tests we don't
# need them here. In addition, we skip MacOS on merge to dev as this happens frequently
# and the differences between Ubuntu and MacOS are minimal compared with the higher
# time unit cost of MacOS tests. Finally if we are merging with master we run the MacOS
# tests as well.
