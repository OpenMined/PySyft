# OpenMined UI

Welcome to OpenMined UI, or "OMUI" for short, the user interface component
system for all OpenMined projects. In this documentation we will describe the
intended uses of our system, explain how it applies to various members of our
community, as well as elaborate on technical specifications. Here's a high-level
overview of this system:

- ⌨️ &nbsp; Developed using [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) to
  allow for rich code editor integration
- ⚛️ &nbsp; Ready to be imported into any [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) web
  application

## Goals

The OMUI design system should accomplish the following goals:

1. **Quick** - Be quick to iterate on UI's for data scientists and other
   non-designer stakeholders
2. **Smart** - Have intelligent defaults set for user experience
3. **Centralized** - Be a single source of truth for both UI designers and
   developers alike
4. **Flexible** - Be easily extensible by those concerned with the fine details
5. **Deliberate** - Allow all OpenMined web applications, community developed or
   officially maintained, to be "on brand"

## How to Read this Document

If this is your first time diving into OMUI, we highly suggest that you start
reading all the documents on the left-hand side from the top to the bottom, in
order. We've organized our documentation to where it reads in a logical order.
However, there are a few details worth noticing:

- **The "Introduction" section** is primarily used to give an overview of
  everything you'll see in the OMUI system.
- **The "Primitives" section** is intended to be technical documentation for the
  most base-level ("primitive") components of the system. These components are
  often the building blocks for much more complex components. In the world of
  [Atomic Design](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/), they are
  our "Atoms".
- **The "Components" section** is intended to be technical documentation for all
  complex components in the system. These are the ones you will use most often
  when devleoping a user interface. In the world of
  [Atomic Design](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/), they are
  our "Molecules" and "Organisms".

## Methodology

The methodology behind this UI system is to solve a few needs, depending on who
is using it. Below, we'll explore the main consumers of this system based on our
particular community's needs.

### For Data Scientists

Our community is primarily comprised of data scientists and other machine
learning professionals. In their normal practice of rapid iteration, it is
helpful to create user interfaces that are:

1. Quick and easy to create and iterate
2. Visually appealing
3. Representative of the OpenMined brand

To help data scientists quickly bring their application ideas to life, OMUI was
built to be easily used out of the box. Intelligent UX defaults allow data
scientists to iterate quickly without having to be UI experts. When a rapid
prototype is ready to be made into an application OMUI gives incredible
flexibility to front-end developers to then extend and customize the base
components as needed.

### For UI Designers

In most design software, to show any form of interaction on a particular design
prototype, a UI designer needs to duplicate the contents of an entire screen
just to show a slight alteration in "state" (i.e. a button being pressed, a
dialog box opening, etc.). For pages where there are many stateful permutations,
this can get out of control very quickly. Because of the stateless nature of
most design prototyping software, design presentations end up being very
unrealistic and "staggered" in appearance.

Framer is one of a slew of new design prototyping tools developed in the last
few years, but is unique for its emphasis on interactivity via "code
components". The OMUI design system is integrated deeply with Framer, allowing
OpenMined's design team the ability to **use real-world, production-ready UI
components** in their prototypes. This also means that OMUI is the "single
source of truth" for what components look like, and how they interact, both in
fully-developed web applications, as well as in design prototypes. With this
workflow, designers are no longer tasked with the handoff process to front-end
developers, where they often end up playing the double-role of QA manager.

### For Front-end Developers

Any React developer who has used Styled System in a project, will likely end up
finding themselves to be a disciple pretty quickly. Having the ability to set a
base-level of default "style props", but with the ability to override them
per-component, provides flexibility that is unparalleled by other component
design approaches.

Rather than develop and entire UI system ourselves, we instead opted to
piggy-back off one of the most well-known (and well-developed) UI component
projects for Styled System: Chakra. All of our components either export Chakra
components directly, build on them to make them easier to use by non-developers,
or are composed based on Chakra primitive components. The good news is that any
front-end developer who knows Chakra, knows OMUI automatically.
