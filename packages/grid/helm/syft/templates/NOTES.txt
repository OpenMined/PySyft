    =========================================
    Syft Installed
    =========================================
    Check the ingress for your IP by running the command below:

        kubectl get ingress -n {{ .Release.Namespace }}

    Once you have the IP, visit it in your browser:

        http://<IP>

    You should see the welcome page. You can now log in with Syft in Python or Jupyter:

    import syft as sy
    sy.login(url="http://<IP>", email="info@openmined.org", password="yourpass")

    You can see your password in the configmap with:

        kubectl get secret backend-secret -n syft -o yaml | grep defaultRootPassword

    If you used a different email or password, make sure to adjust the login information accordingly.

    =========================================
    Start Jupyter Environment
    =========================================
    You can start a Jupyter environment using the following Docker command:

        docker run --rm -it --network=host openmined/syft-client:${VERSION}

    Consider using `tmux` to keep the Jupyter notebook running in the background.
    This can help manage long-running sessions and maintain your environment active.

    For more information on installation and usage, refer to the OpenMined documentation:
