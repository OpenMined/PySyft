class StrategyMixin(object):
    """
    This mix-in enhances any built-in strategy by arranging for an appropriate
    WorkerModel instance to be constructed as necessary, or for the existing
    one to be reused.

    The WorkerModel in turn arranges for a connection multiplexer to be started
    somewhere (by default in an external process), and for WorkerProcesses to
    grow support for using those top-level services to communicate with remote
    hosts.

    Mitogen:

        A private Broker IO multiplexer thread is created to dispatch IO
        between the local Router and any connected streams, including streams
        connected to Ansible WorkerProcesses, and SSH commands implementing
        connections to remote machines.

        A Router is created that implements message dispatch to any locally
        registered handlers, and message routing for remote streams. Router is
        the junction point through which WorkerProceses and remote SSH contexts
        can communicate.

        Router additionally adds message handlers for a variety of base
        services, review the Standard Handles section of the How It Works guide
        in the documentation.

        A ContextService is installed as a message handler in the connection
        mutliplexer subprocess and run on a private thread. It is responsible
        for accepting requests to establish new SSH connections from worker
        processes, and ensuring precisely one connection exists and is reused
        for subsequent playbook steps. The service presently runs in a single
        thread, so to begin with, new SSH connections are serialized.

        Finally a mitogen.unix listener is created through which WorkerProcess
        can establish a connection back into the connection multiplexer, in
        order to avail of ContextService. A UNIX listener socket is necessary
        as there is no more sane mechanism to arrange for IPC between the
        Router in the connection multiplexer, and the corresponding Router in
        the worker process.

    Ansible:

        PluginLoader monkey patches are installed to catch attempts to create
        connection and action plug-ins.

        For connection plug-ins, if the desired method is "local" or "ssh", it
        is redirected to one of the "mitogen_*" connection plug-ins. That
        plug-in implements communication via a UNIX socket connection to the
        connection multiplexer process, and uses ContextService running there
        to establish a persistent connection to the target.

        For action plug-ins, the original class is looked up as usual, but a
        new subclass is created dynamically in order to mix-in
        ansible_mitogen.target.ActionModuleMixin, which overrides many of the
        methods usually inherited from ActionBase in order to replace them with
        pure-Python equivalents that avoid the use of shell.

        In particular, _execute_module() is overridden with an implementation
        that uses ansible_mitogen.target.run_module() executed in the target
        Context. run_module() implements module execution by importing the
        module as if it were a normal Python module, and capturing its output
        in the remote process. Since the Mitogen module loader is active in the
        remote process, all the heavy lifting of transferring the action module
        and its dependencies are automatically handled by Mitogen.
