# This is not the real Strategy implementation module, it simply exists as a
# proxy to the real module, which is loaded using Python's regular import
# mechanism, to prevent Ansible's PluginLoader from making up a fake name that
# results in ansible_mitogen plugin modules being loaded twice: once by
# PluginLoader with a name like "ansible.plugins.strategy.mitogen", which is
# stuffed into sys.modules even though attempting to import it will trigger an
# ImportError, and once under its canonical name, "ansible_mitogen.strategy".
#
# Therefore we have a proxy module that imports it under the real name, and
# sets up the duff PluginLoader-imported module to just contain objects from
# the real module, so duplicate types don't exist in memory, and things like
# debuggers and isinstance() work predictably.
