#: Default size for calls to :meth:`Side.read` or :meth:`Side.write`, and the
#: size of buffers configured by :func:`mitogen.parent.create_socketpair`. This
#: value has many performance implications, 128KiB seems to be a sweet spot.
#:
#: * When set low, large messages cause many :class:`Broker` IO loop
#:   iterations, burning CPU and reducing throughput.
#: * When set high, excessive RAM is reserved by the OS for socket buffers (2x
#:   per child), and an identically sized temporary userspace buffer is
#:   allocated on each read that requires zeroing, and over a particular size
#:   may require two system calls to allocate/deallocate.
#:
#: Care must be taken to ensure the underlying kernel object and receiving
#: program support the desired size. For example,
#:
#: * Most UNIXes have TTYs with fixed 2KiB-4KiB buffers, making them unsuitable
#:   for efficient IO.
#: * Different UNIXes have varying presets for pipes, which may not be
#:   configurable. On recent Linux the default pipe buffer size is 64KiB, but
#:   under memory pressure may be as low as 4KiB for unprivileged processes.
#: * When communication is via an intermediary process, its internal buffers
#:   effect the speed OS buffers will drain. For example OpenSSH uses 64KiB
#:   reads.
#:
#: An ideal :class:`Message` has a size that is a multiple of
#: :data:`CHUNK_SIZE` inclusive of headers, to avoid wasting IO loop iterations
#: writing small trailer chunks.

    A poller manages OS file descriptors the user is waiting to become

    Each descriptor has an associated `data` element, which is unique for each
    readiness type, and defaults to being the same as the file descriptor. The
    :meth:`poll` method yields the data associated with a descriptor, rather
    than the descriptor itself, allowing concise loops like::

            callback()  # invoke appropriate bound instance method

    Pollers may be modified while :meth:`poll` is yielding results. Removals
    are processed immediately, causing pending events for the descriptor to be
    discarded.

    The :meth:`close` method must be called when a poller is discarded to avoid
    a resource leak.
