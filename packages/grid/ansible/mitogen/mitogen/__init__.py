    Convenience decorator primarily useful for writing discardable test
    scripts.

    In the master process, when `func` is defined in the :mod:`__main__`
    module, arranges for `func(router)` to be invoked immediately, with
    :py:class:`mitogen.master.Router` construction and destruction handled just
    as in :py:func:`mitogen.utils.run_with_router`. In slaves, this function
    does nothing.

    :param str log_level:
        Logging package level to configure via
        :py:func:`mitogen.utils.log_to_file`.

    :param bool profiling:
        If :py:data:`True`, equivalent to setting
        :py:attr:`mitogen.master.Router.profiling` prior to router
        construction. This causes ``/tmp`` files to be created everywhere at
        the end of a successful run with :py:mod:`cProfile` output for every
        thread.

    Example:

    ::

        import mitogen
        import requests

        def get_url(url):
            return requests.get(url).text

            z = router.ssh(hostname='k3')
