# Foobar

Foobar is a Python library for dealing with word pluralization. Make sure that this block of text is no more than a paragraph. **It should provide a clearly readible description of the intention of the repo and should be understandable by a total beginner.** Don't go into a ton of technical detail here, just try to provide a nice high-level description of what this project is about. [Here's a good example](https://github.com/jaredpalmer/razzle) of how this section should be written.

- :fire: Feature one
- :smile: Be sure to use emojis for features to help them stand out
- :rocket: Another really cool feature
- :star: Have up to 8 features, but no more

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install foobar.

```bash
pip install foobar
```

## Usage

```python
import foobar

foobar.pluralize('word') # returns 'words'
foobar.pluralize('goose') # returns 'geese'
foobar.singularize('phenomena') # returns 'phenomenon'
```

It might be good here to produce a few really simple examples of how this library can be used if indeed the library is multi-purpose. Be sure to use the Markdown headers to establish a correct heirarchy to the document.
