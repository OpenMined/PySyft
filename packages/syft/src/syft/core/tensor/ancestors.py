    description1 = """You've arrived here because you called Tensor.private() without passing in any data_subjects!
Since the purpose of .private() is to add metadata for the support of automatic differential
privacy budgeting, you need to describe which parts of your Tensor correspond to which
real-world data subjects (data_subjects) whose privacy you want to protect. This is the only
way the system knows, for example, that it costs twice as much privacy budget when twice
as much of your data (say, 2 rows instead of 1 row) refer to the same data subject."""

    description2 = """Entities can be people (such as a medical patient), places (such as a family's address), or
even organizations (such as a business, state, or country). If you're not sure what kind of data subject
to include, just ask yourself the question, "who am I trying to protect the privacy of?". If it's
an organization, make one data subject per organization. If it's people, make one data subject per person.
If it's a group of people who are somehow similar/linked to each other (such as a family),
make each data subject a different group. For more information on differential privacy, see OpenMined's
course on the subject: https://courses.openmined.org/"""

going to guide you through the process of annotating your data with data_subjects."""

    description4 = """In this wizard, we're going to ask you for *unique identifiers* which refer to the data_subjects
in your data. While the unique identifiers need not be personal data (they can be random strings of letters and numbers
if you like). It is ESSENTIAL that you use the same identifier when referring to the same data subject in the
data that you never accidentally refer to two data_subjects by the same identifier. Additionally, if you plan
to do any kind of data JOIN with another dataset, it is ESSENTIAL that you are using the same unique
identifiers for data_subjects as the data you're joining with. Since these unique identifiers may be personal
information, PySyft might not be able to detect if two tensors are using different identifiers for the
same person."""

    description5 = """So, in this tutorial we're going to be asking you to specify Unique Identifiers (UIDs) for each
data subject in your data. This could be an email, street address, or any other string that identifies someone
uniquely in your data and in the data you intend to use with your data (if any)."""
