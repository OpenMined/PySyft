"""In this test suite, we evaluate the ObjectWithID class. For more info
on the ObjectWithID class and its purpose, please see the documentation
in the class itself.

Table of Contents:
    - INITIALIZATION: tests for various ways ObjectWithID can/can't be initialized
    - CLASS METHODS: tests for the use of ObjectWithID's class methods
    - SERDE: test for serialization and deserialization of ObjectWithID.
    - CHILDREN: test that subclasses of ObjectWithID fulfil standards
