PySyft Duet (WebRTC)

This class aims to implement the PySyft Duet concept by using WebRTC protocol as a
connection channel in order to allow two different users to establish a direct
connection with high-quality Real-time Communication using private addresses.

The most common example showing how it can be used is the notebook demo example:

Two different jupyter / collab notebooks in different machines using private addresses
behind routers, proxies and firewalls can connect using a full-duplex channel
to perform machine learning and data science tasks, working as a client
and server at the same time.

PS 1: You need a signaling server running somewhere.
If you don't know any public address running this service, or want to set up your own
signaling network you can use PyGrid's network app.

For local development you can run:
$ python src/syft/grid/example_nodes/network.py

PS 2: The PyGrid's dev / main branches are still supporting PySyft 0.2.x,
To use this feature you must use the pygrid_0.3.0 branch.
(https://github.com/OpenMined/PyGrid/tree/pygrid_0.3.0)

You can get more details about all this process, in the syft/grid/connections/webrtc.py
source code.
