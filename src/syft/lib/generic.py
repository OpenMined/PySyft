class ObjectConstructor(object):
    """Syft allows for the extension and remote execution of a range of python libraries. As such,
    a common need is the ability to modify library-specific constructors of objects.

    For example in the PyTorch framework we might wish to:
     - extend the th.Tensor constructor with new attributes such as "id" and "owner".
     - add additional functionality before/after th.Tensor() such as object registration (or memory re-use)

    However, as most deep learning frameworks are Python code wrapping C++, they often have very "locked down"
    __init__ and __new__ method definitions, which makes it difficult to modify their constructors in the
    conventional way. Furthermore, most frameworks (including Tensorflow, PyTorch, and NumPy), occasionally
    have multiple ways of constructing the same object (tensorflow.constant vs tensorflow.Tensor, and
    torch.Tensor vs torch.tensor) being two examples. Note that in each of these examples, one of the ways
    is the actual TYPE of tensor (th.Tensor) while the other is merely a method which can be used to create
    the tensor (th.tensor).

    As many constructors are difficult to overload (or perhaps have differing ways to overload them), we
    must use a more creative approach to augmenting constructor functionality. Instead of overloading __new__
    or __init__, we create a series of 3 methods (pre_init, init, and post_init) within
    this ObjectConstructor class. Then, when you call __call__ on this class, it initializes the object
    using all three methods. Once we have defined this class, we then take a 2-step approach to *install* this class
    within an existing library.

    1) COPY: we copy the existing constructor to a "original_<name>" location. For example:

            th.original_Tensor = th.Tensor

    2) REPLACE: we then replace the original class path name with an instance of this constructor. For example:

            th.Tensor = TensorConstructor() #where TensorConstructor is an instance of ObjectConstructor

    This allows us to have a SINGLE way of implementing the following functionality for any object and installing it
    into the library (ensuring that all instances of that object use our constructor, even instances created from
    within the framework itself):

        - arbitrary custom args and kwargs,
        - arbitrary arg and kwarg manipulation
        - arbitrary functionality before the underlying (original) object constructor is called
        - arbitrary functionality after the underlying (original) object constructor is called.

    Thus, if any object has its functionality extended or overridden by PySyft, it should be created using
    an extension of this class.

    GARBAGE COLLECTION NOTES:

    There is a special case in codebases which wrap C++ functionality wherein an object can be created on the
    C++ side, a Python wrapper is created (calling our constructor above). However, some methods can destroy
    and then re-create the Python wrapper without destroying or re-creating the underlying tensor. This can be very
    tricky to deal with for a variety of reasons. However, we have observed that we can override this ability by:

    - caching the Python object somewhere so that the original python object doesn't get destroyed until it should be
    - intelligently remembering that this object has been created before when the constructor is called for the
        second time. This assume we can have stable "ID"s across creations of the tensor.

    This can be very tricky to implement but we have been able to make stable codebases with one or both of these
    approaches.
