    This function deserializes from an encoding to a Python object. There are a few ways of
    using this function:
        1. An Message object is passed, this will transform a protobuf message into its
        associated class. the from_proto has to be set (it is by default).
        2. Bytes are passed. This requires the from_bytes flag set the schema_type specified.
        We cannot (and we should not) be able to get the schema_type from the binary
        representation.
        3. A hex string is passed. This will be transformed to binary and afterwards the
        second step is applied. The from_hex flag should be set and the schema_type should be
        specified.
        4. A json object is passed. The from_json flag must be set and the schema_type should
        be specified.

    Note: The only format that does not require the schema_type is when we are passing
    Messages directly.

    Raises: ValueError if you are not setting one from_<protocol> flag.
            ValueError if you are deserializing a data type that requires a schema type and not
            providing one.
            TypeError if you are are trying to deserialize an unsupported type.
