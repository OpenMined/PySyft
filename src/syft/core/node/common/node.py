        #
        # 1) services which do not return a reply
        # can typically be run on a more flexible time-table, whereas
        # services which require a reply often care about the latency
        # of the reply.
        #
        # 2) Services which do not return a reply aren't likely to leak
        # any information because no information is leaving. Thus, our
        # privacy/security concerns are more concentrated within service
        # which reply with some amount of information.
