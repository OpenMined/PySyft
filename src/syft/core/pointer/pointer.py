"""A Pointer is the main handler when interacting with remote data.
A Pointer object represents an API for interacting with data (of any type)
at a specific location. The pointer should never be instantiated, only subclassed.

The relation between pointers and data is many to one,
there can be multiple pointers pointing to the same piece of data, meanwhile,
a pointer cannot point to multiple data sources.

A pointer is just an object id on a remote location and a set of methods that can be
executed on the remote machine directly on that object. One note that has to be made
is that all operations between pointers will return a pointer, the only way to have access
to the result is by calling .get() on the pointer.

There are two proper ways of receiving a pointer on some data:
    1. When sending that data on a remote machine the user receives a pointer.
    2. When the user searches for the data in an object store it receives a pointer to that data,
    if it has the correct permissions for that.

After receiving a pointer, one might want to get the data behind the pointer locally. For that the
user should:
    1. Request access by calling .request().
    Example:

    .. code-block::

        pointer_object.request(name = "Request name", reason = "Request reason")

    2.1 - The data owner has to approve the request (check the domain node docs).
    2.2 - The data user checks if the request has been approved (check the domain node docs).
    3. After the request has been approved, the data user can call .get() on the pointer to get the
    data locally.
    Example:

    .. code-block::

        pointer_object.get()

Pointers are being generated for most types of objects in the data science scene, but what you can
do on them is not the pointers job, see the lib module for more details. One can see the pointer
as a proxy to the actual data, the filtering and the security being applied where the data is being
held.

Example:

.. code-block::

    # creating the data holder domain
    domain_1 = Domain(name="Data holder domain")

    # creating dummy data
    tensor = th.tensor([1, 2, 3])

    # creating the data holder client
    domain_1_client = domain_1.get_root_client()

    # sending the data to the client and receiving a pointer of that data.
    data_ptr_domain_1 = tensor.send(domain_1_client) # or tensor.send_to(domain_1_client)

    # creating the data user domain
    domain_2 = Domain(name="Data user domain")

    # creating a request to access the data
    data_ptr_domain_1.request(
        name="My Request", reason="I'd lke to see this pointer"
    )

    # getting the remote id of the object
    requested_object = data_ptr_domain_1.id_at_location

    # getting the request id
    message_request_id = domain_1_client.request_queue.get_request_id_from_object_id(
        object_id=requested_object
    )

    # the data holder accepts the request
    domain_1.requests[0].owner_client_if_available = domain_1_client
    domain_1.requests[0].accept()

    # the data user checks if the data holder approved his request
    response = data_ptr_domain_1.check_access(node=domain_2, request_id=message_request_id)
