    Basic class for a syft worker behavior, explicit purpose workers will
    inherit this class (eg. WebsocketWorker, VirtualWorker).

    A worker is a collection of objects owned by a machine, a list of supported
    frameworks used for remote execution and a message router. The objects
    owned by the worker are placed in an ObjectStore object, the list of
    frameworks are a list of Globals and the message router is a dict that maps
    a message type to a processing method.

    Each worker is identified by an id of type str.
