        Args:
            owner: A BaseWorker parameter to specify the worker on which the
                pointer is located. It is also where the pointer is registered
                if register is set to True.
            location: The BaseWorker object which points to the worker on which
                this pointer's object can be found. In nearly all cases, this
                is self.owner and so this attribute can usually be left blank.
                Very rarely you may know that you are about to move the Tensor
                to another worker so you can pre-initialize the location
                attribute of the pointer to some other worker, but this is a
                rare exception.
            ptr_id: A string or integer parameter to specify the id of the pointer.
            id_at_location: A string or integer id of the object being pointed
                to. Similar to location, this parameter is almost always
                self.id and so you can leave this parameter to None. The only
                exception is if you happen to know that the ID is going to be
                something different than self.id, but again this is very rare
                and most of the time, setting this means that you are probably
                doing something you shouldn't.

                pointer is deleted.
