    This is the class which contains functionality generic to all workers. Other workers will
    extend this class to inherit all functionality necessary for PySyft's protocol. Extensions
    of this class will override two key methods _send_msg() and _recv_msg() which are responsible
    for defining the procedure for sending a binary message to another worker.

    At it's core, you can think of BaseWorker (and thus all workers) as simply a collection of
    objects owned by a certain machine. Each worker defines how it interacts with objects on other
    workers as well as how other workers interact with objects owned by itself. Objects are most
    frequently tensors but they can be of any type supported by the PySyft protocol.
