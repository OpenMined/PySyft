class BaseWorker(AbstractWorker, ObjectStorage):
    """Contains functionality to all workers.

    Other workers will extend this class to inherit all functionality necessary
    for PySyft's protocol. Extensions of this class overrides two key methods
    _send_msg() and _recv_msg() which are responsible for defining the
    procedure for sending a binary message to another worker.

    At it's core, BaseWorker (and all workers) is a collection of objects owned
    by a certain machine. Each worker defines how it interacts with objects on
    other workers as well as how other workers interact with objects owned by
    itself. Objects are either tensors or of any type supported by the PySyft
    protocol.

    Args:
        hook: A reference to the TorchHook object which is used
            to modify PyTorch with PySyft's functionality.
        id: An optional string or integer unique id of the worker.
        known_workers: An optional dictionary of all known workers on a
            network which this worker may need to communicate with in the
            future. The key of each should be each worker's unique ID and
            the value should be a worker class which extends BaseWorker.
            Extensions of BaseWorker will include advanced functionality
            for adding to this dictionary(node discovery). In some cases,
            one can initialize this with known workers to help bootstrap
            the network.
        data: Initialize workers with data on creating worker object
        is_client_worker: An optional boolean parameter to indicate
            whether this worker is associated with an end user client. If
            so, it assumes that the client will maintain control over when
            variables are instantiated or deleted as opposed to handling
            tensor/variable/model lifecycle internally. Set to True if this
            object is not where the objects will be stored, but is instead
            a pointer to a worker that eists elsewhere.
        log_msgs: An optional boolean parameter to indicate whether all
            messages should be saved into a log for later review. This is
            primarily a development/testing feature.
        auto_add: Determines whether to automatically add this worker to the
            list of known workers.
