# Summary of what is going on here
# SocketIO events are executed in the thread that launches this object
# A second thread is created in by calling _init_job_thread() (would it be better to create them for each client)
# When a client connects to the socket a the payload is passed to this second thread
# PySyft _recv_msg will perform a socketio.emit('message', message) for each operation and then it will wait until
# the client responds via on_new_client_message. In this method, the semaphore used by _recv_msg to wait is lifted
# allowing it to continue by working with the result sent by the client
