    Given two tensors shape, build three lists referencing specific dimension indices where
    the dimension for the two tensors is not the same:

    Note that we assume len(x_shape) <= len(y_shape) and inverse x and y if necessary.

    1. If one tensor has a longer shape (so lives in higher dimension)(so it is y because
    len(x_shape) <= len(y_shape)), then all the extra dimensions indices end up in x_squash_dims.
    Indeed, x will be automatically expanded in all the extra dimensions at forward operation time
    to match the tensor with the highest dimension. Example: tensor([1]) + tensor([[2], [3]]) is
    rewritten by torch as tensor([[1], [1]]) + tensor([[2], [3]]). So we need to remove all these
    dimensions of expansion to get back the gradient of x.

    2. If x or y has a 1 in some dimension and doesn't match the other tensor
    (ex: torch.Size([3, 7, 5]) and torch.Size([3, 1, 5])), then when an operation is called the
    tensor is expanded on this dimension, so we need to register this information to do the same
    squashing as before but we keep the dimension this time. This apply to both tensors and hence
    we use the lists x_squash_keep_dims and y_squash_keep_dims

    3. current_dim is used to keep count of the dimension, as we iterate on the dimension starting
    from the highest (the most right one) down to zero. Generally, remember that the shape tuple
    should match when align on the right, unless there is a 1 instead of the other value: shapes
    (5,4,3,2) and (4,1,2) are compatible, (5,4,3,2) and (5,4,2,2) are not.
