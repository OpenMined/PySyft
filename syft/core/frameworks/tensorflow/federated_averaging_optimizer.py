class FederatedAveragingOptimizer(optimizer.Optimizer):
    """Class to synchronize and aggregate model params.

    In a typical synchronous training environment, gradients will be averaged each
    step and then applied to the variables in one shot, after which replicas can
    fetch the new variables and continue. In a federated average training environment,
    model variables will be averaged every 'interval_steps' steps, and then the
    replicas will fetch the new variables and continue training locally. In the
    interval between two average operations, there is no data transfer, which can
    accelerate training.

    The following accumulators/queue are created:
    <empty line>
    * N `parameter accumulators`, one per variable to train. Local variables are
    pushed to them and the chief worker will wait until enough variables are
    collected and then average them. The accumulator will drop all stale variables
    (more details in the accumulator op).
    * 1 `token` queue where the optimizer pushes the new global_step value after
      all variables are updated.

    The following local variable is created:
    * `global_step`, one per replica. Updated after every average operation.

    The optimizer adds nodes to the graph to collect local variables and pause
    the trainers until variables are updated.
    For the Parameter Server job:
    <empty line>
    1. An accumulator is created for each variable, and each replica pushes the
       local variables into the accumulators.
    2. Each accumulator averages once enough variables (replicas_to_aggregate)
       have been accumulated.
    3. Apply the averaged variables to global variables.
    4. Only after all variables have been updated, increment the global step.
    5. Only after step 4, pushes a token in the `token_queue`, once for
       each worker replica. The workers can now fetch the token and start
       the next round.

    For the replicas:
    <empty line>
    1. Start a training block: fetch variables and train for "interval_steps" steps.
    2. Once the training block has been computed, push local variables into variable
       accumulators. Each accumulator will check the staleness and drop the stale.
    3. After pushing all the variables, dequeue a token from the token queue and
       continue training. Note that this is effectively a barrier.
    4. Fetch new variables and start the next block.

    ### Usage

    ```python
    # Create any optimizer to update the variables, say a simple SGD:
    opt = GradientDescentOptimizer(learning_rate=0.1)

    # Wrap the optimizer with fed_avg_optimizer with 50 replicas: at each
    # step the FederatedAveragingOptimizer collects "replicas_to_aggregate" variables
    # before applying the average. Note that if you want to have 2 backup replicas,
    # you can change total_num_replicas=52 and make sure this number matches how
    # many physical replicas you started in your job.
    opt = fed_avg_optimizer.FederatedAveragingOptimizer(opt,
                                                        replicas_to_aggregate=50,
                                                        is_chief=True,
                                                        interval_steps=100,
                                                        device_setter)

    # Some models have startup_delays to help stabilize the model but when using
    # federated_average training, set it to 0.

    # Now you can call 'minimize() normally'
    # train_op = opt.minimize(loss, global_step=global_step)

    # And also, create the hook which handles initialization.
    fed_avg_hook = opt.make_session_run_hook()
    ```

    In the training program, every worker will run the train_op as if not
    averaged or synchronized. Note that if you want to run other ops like
    test op, you should use common session instead of MonitoredSession:

    ```python
    with training.MonitoredTrainingSession(
        master=workers[worker_id].target,
        hooks=[fed_avg_hook]) as mon_sess:
      while not mon_sess.should_stop():
        mon_sess.run(training_op)
        sess = mon_sess._tf_sess()
        sess.run(testing_op)
    ```
