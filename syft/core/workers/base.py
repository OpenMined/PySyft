class BaseWorker(ABC):
    r"""
    The BaseWorker class establishes a consistent interface for
    communicating between different machines
    about tensors, variables, models, and other network related
    information. It defines base functionality
    for storing objects within the worker (or in some cases
    specifically not storing them), and for keeping
    track of known workers across a network.

    This class does NOT include any communication specific functionality
    such as peer-to-peer protocols, routing, node discovery, or even
    socket architecture. Only classes that extend the BaseWorker should
    carry such functionality.

    :Parameters:

        * **hook (**:class:`.hooks.BaseHook` **)** This is a reference
          to the hook object which overloaded the underlying deep
          learning framework.

        * **id (int or string, optional)** the integer or string identifier
          for this node

        * **is_client_worker (bool, optional)** a boolean which determines
          whether this worker is associeted with an end user client.
          If so, it assumes that the client will maintain control over when
          tensors/variables/models are instantiated or deleted as opposed
          to handling tensor/variable/model lifecycle internally.

        * **objects (list of tensors, variables, or models, optional)**
          When the worker is NOT a client worker, it stores all tensors
          it receives or creates in this dictionary.
          The key to each object is it's id.

        * **tmp_objects (list of tensors, variables, or models, optional)**
          When the worker IS a client worker, it stores some tensors
          temporarily in this _tmp_objects simply to ensure
          that they do not get deallocated by the Python garbage
          collector while in the process of being registered.
          This dictionary can be emptied using the clear_tmp_objects method.

        * **known_workers (list of **:class:`BaseWorker` ** objects, optional)**
          This dictionary can include all known workers on a network.
          Some extensions of BaseWorker will use this
          list to bootstrap the network.

        * **verbose (bool, optional)** A flag for whether or not to
          print events to stdout.

        This method adds an object (such as a tensor) to one of
        the internal object registries. The main registry
        holds objects for a long period of time (until they are
        explicitly deleted) while the temporary registory
        will delete all object references contained therein when
        the cleanup method is called (self._clear_tmp_objects).


        The reason we have a temporary registry for clijen workers
        (instead of putting everything in the permanent one) is
        because when the client creates a reference to an object
        (x = torch.zeros(10)), we want to ensure that the client
        contains the only pointer to that object so that when the
        client deletes the object that __del__ gets called. If,
        however, the object was also being stored in the permanent
        registry (self._objects), then when the variable went out
        of scope on the client, the python garbage collector wouldn't
        call __del__ because the internal registry would
        still have a reference to it. So, we use the temporary registry
        during the construction of the object but then
        delete all references to the object (other than the client's)
        once object construction and (recursive) registration
        is complete.

        When the worker is not a client worker (self._is_client_worker==False),
        this method just saves an object into the permanent registry,
        where it remains until it is explicitly deleted using self._rm_obj.

        :Parameters:

        * **remote_key (int)** This is an object id to an object to be
          stored in memory.

        * **value (torch.Tensor or torch.autograd.Variable) ** the
          object to be stored in memory.

        * **force (bool, optional)** if set to True, this will force the
          object to be stored in permenent memory, even if
          the current worker is a client worker (Default: False).

        * **tmp (bobol, optional)** if set to True, this will allow an object
          to be stored in temporary memory if and only if
          the worker is also a client worker. If set to false, the object
          will not be stored in temporary memory, even if the
          worker is a client worker.
