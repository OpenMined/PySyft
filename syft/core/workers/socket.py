class SocketWorker(BaseWorker):
    """A worker capable of performing the functions of a BaseWorker across a
    socket connection. Note that the worker is NOT responsible for creating the
    socket connection.

    :Parameters:


    * **hook (**:class:`.hooks.BaseHook` **)** This is a reference to
      the hook object which overloaded the underlying deep learning framework.

    * **id (int or string, optional)** the integer or string identifier
      for this node

    * **is_client_worker (bool, optional)** a boolean which determines
      whether this worker is associeted with an end user client. If so,
      it assumes that the client will maintain control over when
      tensors/variables/models are instantiated or deleted as opposed to
      handling tensor/variable/model lifecycle internally.

    * **objects (list of tensors, variables, or models, optional)**
      When the worker is NOT a client worker, it stores all tensors
      it receives or creates in this dictionary.
      The key to each object is it's id.

    * **tmp_objects (list of tensors, variables, or models, optional)**
      When the worker IS a client worker, it stores some tensors temporarily
      in this _tmp_objects simply to ensure that they do not get deallocated by
      the Python garbage collector while in the process of being registered.
      This dictionary can be emptied using the clear_tmp_objects method.

    * **known_workers (list of **:class:`BaseWorker` ** objects, optional)** This dictionary
      can include all known workers.

    * **verbose (bool, optional)** A flag for whether or not to print events to stdout.
