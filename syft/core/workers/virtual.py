from .base import BaseWorker


class VirtualWorker(BaseWorker):
    r"""
    A virtualized worker simulating the existence of a remote machine.
    It is intended as a testing, development, and performance evaluation
    tool that exists independent of a live or local network of workers.
    You don't even have to be connected to the internet to create a pool
    of Virtual Workers and start running computations on them.

    :Parameters:


    * **hook (**:class:`.hooks.BaseHook` **)** This is a reference to
      the hook object which overloaded the underlying deep learning framework.

    * **id (int or string, optional)** the integer or string identifier
      for this node

    * **is_client_worker (bool, optional)** a boolean which determines
      whether this worker is associeted with an end user client. If so,
      it assumes that the client will maintain control over when
      tensors/variables/models are instantiated or deleted as opposed to
      handling tensor/variable/model lifecycle internally.

    * **objects (list of tensors, variables, or models, optional)**
      When the worker is NOT a client worker, it stores all tensors
      it receives or creates in this dictionary.
      The key to each object is it's id.

    * **tmp_objects (list of tensors, variables, or models, optional)**
      When the worker IS a client worker, it stores some tensors temporarily
      in this _tmp_objects simply to ensure that they do not get deallocated by
      the Python garbage collector while in the process of being registered.
      This dictionary can be emptied using the clear_tmp_objects method.

    * **known_workers (list of **:class:`BaseWorker` ** objects, optional)** This dictionary
      can include all known workers.

    * **verbose (bool, optional)** A flag for whether or not to print events to stdout.

    :Example:

    >>> from syft.core.hooks import TorchHook
    >>> from syft.core.hooks import torch
    >>> from syft.core.workers import VirtualWorker
    >>> hook = TorchHook()
    Hooking into Torch...
    Overloading complete.
    >>> local = hook.local_worker
    >>> remote = VirtualWorker(id=1, hook=hook)
    >>> local.add_worker(remote)
    >>> x = torch.FloatTensor([1,2,3,4,5])
