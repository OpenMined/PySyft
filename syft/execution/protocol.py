    A Protocol coordinates a sequence of Plans, deploys them on distant workers
    and run them in a single pass.

    It's a high level object which contains the logic of a complex computation
    distributed across several workers. The main feature of Protocol is the
    ability to be sent / searched / fetched back between workers, and finally
    deployed to identified workers. So a user can design a protocol, upload it
    to a cloud worker, and any other workers will be able to search for it,
    download it, and apply the computation program it contains on the workers
    that it is connected to.


    Args:
        plans: a list of pairs (worker, plan). "worker" can be either a real
            worker or a worker id or a string to represent a fictive worker. This
            last case can be used at creation to specify that two plans should be
            owned (or not owned) by the same worker at deployment. "plan" can
            either be a Plan or a PointerPlan.
