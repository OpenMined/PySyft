        This function takes the simplified tuple version of this message and converts

            worker (AbstractWorker): a reference to the worker necessary for detailing. Read
                syft/serde/serde.py for more information on why this is necessary.
            msg_tuple (Tuple): the raw information being detailed.

            ptr (ObjectRequestMessage): a ObjectRequestMessage.
