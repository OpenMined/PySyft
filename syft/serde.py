"""
This file exists to provide one common place for all serialization to occur
regardless of framework. As msgpack only supports basic types and binary formats
every type must be first be converted to one of these types. Thus, we've split our
functionality into three steps. When converting from a PySyft object (or collection
of objects) to an object to be sent over the wire (a message), those three steps
are (in order):

1. Simplify - converts PyTorch objects to simple Python objects (using pickle)
2. Serialize - converts Python objects to binary
3. Compress - compresses the binary (Now we're ready send!)

Inversely, when converting from a message sent over the wire back to a PySyft
object, the three steps are (in order):

1. Decompress - converts compressed binary back to decompressed binary
2. Deserialize - converts from binary to basic python objects
3. Detail - converts some basic python objects back to PyTorch objects (Tensors)

Furthermore, note that there is different simplification/serialization logic
for objects of different types. Thus, instead of using if/else logic, we have
global dictionaries which contain functions and Python types as keys. For
simplification logic, this dictionary is called "simplifiers". The keys
are the types and values are the simplification logic. For example,
simplifiers[tuple] will return the function which knows how to simplify the
tuple type. The same is true for all other simplifier/detailer functions.

By default, we serialize using msgpack and compress using lz4.
